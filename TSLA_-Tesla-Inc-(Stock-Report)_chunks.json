Tesla also owns a fast-charging network. Tesla aims to retain its market leader status as EVs grow from a niche market to reaching mass consumer adoption. We forecast EVs will reach one in three autos sold globally by 2030. To meet growing demand, Tesla opened two new factories in 2022, increasing its production capacity. Tesla also invests around 4 of its sales in research and development, focusing on improving its market-leading technology and reducing manufacturing costs. For EVs to see mass adoption, long-range EVs need to reach cost parity with internal combustion engines across all vehicle categories. To reduce costs, Tesla focuses on automation and efficiency in its manufacturing process, such as reducing the total number of parts that need to be assembled in a vehicle. The company also designs some of its own batteries. Tesla's goal is to reduce costs by more than 50 over time. EVs also need readily available fast-chargers throughout a region to see mass-market adoption. Tesla continues to expand its supercharging network, which consists of fast chargers built along highways and in cities throughout the US, EU, and China. Tesla is attempting to take a larger share of its customers' auto-related spending, which includes selling autonomous driving software, insurance, and charging. The company also aims to launch a robotaxi service using its autonomous driving software. We expect autonomous vehicles, including Tesla's robotaxi service, to make up 50 of ride-hailing rides in the US and Canada by 2030 as robotaxis are cheaper than human drivers. It also sells solar panels and batteries to consumers and utilities. As the battery-based energy storage market expands, Tesla is well positioned to grow accordingly. Bulls Say Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 23 Apr 2025 uTesla has the potential to disrupt the automotive and power generation industries with its technology for EVs, AVs, batteries, and solar generation systems. uTesla will see higher profit margins as it reduces unit production costs over the next several years.

Bears Say Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 23 Apr 2025 uTraditional automakers and new entrants are investing heavily in EV development, which will result in Tesla seeing a deceleration in sales growth and being forced to cut prices due to increased competition, eroding profit margins. uTesla's large investment into autonomous driving software will be value destructive as the robotaxi product will face delays and competition from Waymo, who already offers a robotaxi service. uTesla CEO Elon Musk's political activities will turn consumers away from buying a Tesla in key markets including the US and Europe, leading to lower sales and profits.

Tesla's moat stems from two of our five moat sources: intangible assets and cost advantage. The company's strong brand cachet as a luxury automaker commands premium pricing, while its EV manufacturing expertise allows the company to make its vehicles cheaper than its competitors. Intangible Assets Tesla's brand cachet is not likely to be impaired anytime soon as other automakers move into the battery electric vehicle space because we expect the company to keep innovating to stay ahead of startup and established competitors. The Model S Plaid, the most upgraded version of Tesla's luxury sedan, offers 390 miles of range, at the high end for electric vehicles. It does 0-60 mph in under 2 seconds and has 1,020 horsepower, putting the Model S Plaid in a rare class of performance among all autos, regardless of powertrain. By focusing on the luxury auto market first, Tesla was able to create tremendous media publicity for the company that reaches beyond its customers. This generated strong consumer demand for its subsequent vehicles at lower price points, such as the Model 3 and Model Y. As other new vehicles are launched, such as the affordable SUV, we expect the company's strong brand will continue to generate consumer demand. Tesla has a more high-tech vehicle with the ability to do drivetrain updates and other updates via Wi-Fi or a cellular connection, and customers do not have to visit a store for many service needs. Tesla will instead pick up the vehicle from home and often return it the same day, while providing a fully loaded loaner for no charge, or visit the customer's home or work and service the car there. This experience is much easier than many other automakers' service, which helps Tesla's brand equity. Further, this has been accomplished with little to no spending on advertising, which is rare for a consumer brand. This strong brand equity has carried over to Tesla's energy generation and storage business, where the company can charge a premium for its fully integrated solar panel, inverter, and home battery storage systems sold to consumers. Tesla's proprietary technology contributes to its intangible asset-driven competitive advantage. This form of intangible assets applies to EVs due to their innovative, highly engineered nature and because patents for EV technologies hold somewhat less value due to the ability of competitors to create alternatively designed, but ultimately similar, products. Since launching the Model S in 2012, Tesla has been the industry leader in electric vehicles, producing the best EVs on the market. The company invests nearly 6 of sales in RD to maintain its best-in-class range, which is well ahead of the competition on a miles per kilowatt-hour basis and continues to improve other vehicle specs such as power. Tesla is also investing heavily in its proprietary autonomous vehicle technology and building one of the world's largest supercomputers to train self-driving artificial intelligence.

Tesla will face increasing competition in the coming years. Automakers plan to electrify their fleets by adding EV versions of existing vehicles and creating new platforms. However, we see EVs becoming a greater proportion of auto sales, growing to 30 by 2030 from 3 in 2020, which will expand the market as EVs rapidly take share from internal combustion engine vehicles. As new models are introduced, Tesla's technological advantage and the strength of its brand will remain intact, which will allow the company to continue to charge a premium price for its EVs. Cost Advantage We think Tesla benefits from a cost advantage in electric vehicles production thanks to its manufacturing scale. Tesla's total vehicle volume has grown from just over 100,000 in 2017 to nearly 1.8 million deliveries in 2024. During the same period, the company's average cost of goods sold per vehicle has fallen over 55, from 84,000 to just over 35,000. While some of this is due to manufacturing a greater proportion of midsize cars and SUVs versus luxury autos, the majority of the COGS decline has come from the company's focus on reducing manufacturing costs due to scale. Legacy automakers are gradually transitioning to BEV production from internal combustion engines, but we expect they will be saddled with legacy ICE costs for a long time. Even as legacy automakers begin to produce more EVs, we expect Tesla will continue to have lower costs as it has outlined a plan to further reduce unit production costs over the next several years with a new manufacturing process. With Tesla's cost per vehicle set to fall, legacy automakers may take years to catch up to Tesla, if ever, as they won't want to build many new factories from scratch like Tesla is doing. We think Tesla's combination of intangible assets and cost advantage will persist in the future and allow the firm to generate excess returns on capital. We see the potential for Tesla to outearn its cost of capital over at least the next 20 years, which is the measurement we use for a wide moat rating. However, the second 10-year period carries significant uncertainty for both Tesla and the broader automotive industry, given the rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle technologies that could transform how consumers use vehicles. As such, we view a narrow moat rating, which assumes a 10- year excess return duration, as more appropriate. Fair Value and Profit DriversSeth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 23 Apr 2025 Our Tesla fair value estimate is 250. We use a weighted average cost of capital of just under 9. Our equity valuation adds back nonrecourse and nondilutive convertible debt. In 2025, we forecast deliveries will slightly fall versus the 1.79 million deliveries in 2024. We expect first half deliveries will be affected by the new Model Y not being solid in all markets, especially in the beginning of the year. However, we forecast a better second half of the year as the affordable vehicle is Morningstar 2025. All Rights Reserved.

As the company is ramping up production of the new vehicles, we expect automotive gross margins excluding credits will remain in the mid-teens, below management's long- term goal of 20. Longer term, we assume Tesla delivers 4.3 million vehicles per year in 2030. Our forecast is well below management's aspirational goal of selling 20 million vehicles by the end of this decade. However, it is a more than double the 1.8 million vehicles delivered in 2024. Our forecast assumes Tesla slightly lower Model 3 and Model Y deliveries and ramps up volume of the Cybertruck to around 50,000 deliveries per year, far below management's goal of 250,000. We forecast Tesla will launch its affordable SUV priced in the mid-30,000 range with some deliveries coming in 2025 and a ramp-up in 2026 at a pace similar to the Model 3 ramp-up in 2018, the first full year the vehicle was sold. We think deliveries of the affordable SUV will exceed those of the Model Y and Model 3, as the lower price point of this vehicle should attract a larger consumer base. We think Tesla will be successful in continuing to reduce its manufacturing costs on a per vehicle basis. We forecast segment gross margin will recover to the low 20s by the end of the decade, above the 19 generated in 2023 but below the 29 achieved in 2022. We assume revenue growth and margin expansion from autonomous software sold on a subscription basis. We also assume the successful growth of the insurance business and increased profits from the charging business result in long-term profit growth and margin expansion in the services and other segment. In energy generation and storage, we assume the business averages annual revenue growth at roughly a 30 range during our 10-year forecast, primarily driven by accelerating demand for energy storage systems. While we forecast ESS prices to decline, the fall will largely be driven by cheaper battery costs, which should not affect profitability. As volume grows, unit costs should fall. Combined with recurring revenue from long-term power purchase agreements and AI trading software, we expect the business will turn profitable and generate gross margins in line with peers such as Enphase and SolarEdge. We assume overhead expenses continue to decline as a percentage of sales as the company benefits from operating leverage as deliveries grow. As a result, we forecast companywide operating margin will return to the midteens by the end of the decade, in line with the 17 achieved in 2022 and well above the 9 in 2023. To fund this growth, we assume Tesla will have around 115 billion in capital expenditures over the next decade. Our base case also adds the present value of Tesla's robotaxi business, Dojo's AI training services, and Morningstar 2025. All Rights Reserved.

We expect robotaxis will enter the ride-hailing market by 2028 and rollout on a city-by-city basis, similar to how Waymo, Uber, and Lyft increased their service locations. Tesla will take an asset-light approach, selling vehicles and then running the software. Our robotaxi valuation account for around 65 per share, or a little more than 20, of our Tesla valuation. Our FSD software subscription valuation accounts for 25 per share, or around 10 of our fair value estimate. Optimus and Dojo combine for roughly 25 per share, an additional 10 of our fair value estimate. Given the wide range of outcomes, we also model upside and downside scenarios. Our upside scenario fair value estimate is 600. In this scenario, we assume Tesla delivers a little over 5 million vehicles per year by 2030 and the company benefits from cost reductions in excess of our base- case forecast. We also value robotaxi at around 175 per share, Optimus and Dojo at a combined 185 per share, and FSD software subscriptions at around 55 per share. Our downside scenario fair value estimate is 100 per share. In a downside scenario, we assume Tesla delivers less than 3.5 million vehicles in 2030. We also assume cost reductions do not materialize as planned and Tesla is forced to cut prices amid increasing competition. This keeps gross margin in the high teens, in line with the 19 generated in 2023. We also assume no economic benefit from autonomous driving software and sees slower growth in the insurance business. We assign no value to the company's ancillary businesses including robotaxis, Dojo's AI training services, and humanoid robots. Risk and UncertaintySeth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 23 Apr 2025 We assign Tesla a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating as we see a wide range of potential outcomes for the company. The automotive market is highly cyclical and subject to sharp demand declines based on economic conditions. As an EV market leader, Tesla is subject to growing competition from traditional automakers and new entrants. As new lower-priced EVs enter the market, Tesla may be forced to continue to cut prices, reducing the firm's industry-leading profits. With more EV choices, consumers may view Tesla less favorably. The company is also investing heavily in RD to develop autonomous driving software, robotaxis, and humanoid robots with no guarantee these investments will bear fruit. As of the last SEC filing, Tesla's CEO owns roughly 12 of the company's stock and uses it as collateral for personal loans, which raises the risk of a large sale to repay debt. Tesla also faces political risk related to the political activities of CEO Elon Musk. Musk serves as an advisor to US President Donald Trump and campaigned for the far-right Alternative for Germany party. These activities risk turning away some consumers from buying a Tesla. Tesla faces ESG risks. As an automaker, Tesla is subject to potential product defects that could result in Morningstar 2025. All Rights Reserved.

We see a moderate impact should this occur. Another risk involves employee retention. If Tesla is unable to retain key employees, such as CEO Elon Musk, its image as an innovative company could decline. We see a low probability but moderate materiality. Additional ESG risks include potential patent litigation as the company relies on new technology to improve its EVs and energy storage systems. We see a low probability but moderate materiality should this occur. Tesla may also face regulatory issues in some US states due to laws that require automakers and dealers to be separate. We see a moderate probability but low materiality. Capital AllocationSeth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 11 Mar 2025 We award Tesla an Exemplary Capital Allocation Rating based on our framework that assesses its balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions. We rate the balance sheet as sound. Tesla's revenue is subject to high cyclicality, and the majority of the company's debt and financial lease obligations are due within the next three years. However, with a healthy balance sheet and cash far exceeding total debt, Tesla should be able to easily meet its financial obligations. We view management's investments as exceptional. Tesla's aspiration is to increase its EV volume from a little under 1.8 million vehicles in 2024 to 20 million by 2030. To do so, the company built new factories around the world, including in China, the EU, and US. Given strong consumer demand, we think the capacity expansion plans make sense. We are also in favor of the company's focus on reducing its manufacturing costs on a per unit basis while investing to maintain its technological advantage. To reduce costs, Tesla makes its own batteries, with plans to increase its own battery cell production from an annual capacity of 100 gigawatt-hours in 2022 to 3 terawatt-hours by 2030. The battery will also be incorporated into the structural design of the EV. Tesla's battery improvements aim to reduce cost on a per kWh basis, increase range, and reduce investment on a per GWh basis. We are in favor of the focus on reducing costs, as this should enable Tesla to keep its cost advantage intact as large legacy automakers electrify further this decade. Reduced manufacturing costs should enable Tesla to increase profit margins for its existing vehicles and produce an affordable sedan and SUV in the future at a profitable level. We also think management is smart to look at adding ancillary revenue streams such as autonomous driving software, which can be a product differentiator if Tesla is successful, as well as selling insurance. We are in favor of the move to open Tesla's charging network to non-Tesla vehicles as it can drive additional revenue and profits from charging stations by increasing the capacity utilization of each station. We see shareholder distributions as appropriate. Tesla does not pay a dividend and to date has not repurchased shares. Instead, it has used the capital markets to issue stock, most recently at value- accretive levels. Given that Tesla is investing heavily in expanding its vehicle and battery production Morningstar 2025. All Rights Reserved.

However, with solid free cash flow generation and little debt, management said it may consider share repurchases in the future. Tesla is currently preparing to begin selling an affordable vehicle and building the required plants to ramp up production. Once this is complete and the initial factories are ramped up, we think share repurchases, at least to offset dilution from stock- based compensation, would make sense with excess cash flow. Elon Musk has been Tesla's CEO since 2008. Before co-founding Tesla, he co-founded and sold the internet payment system PayPal. Musk also co-founded SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Co. Further, Musk purchased Twitter, now called X, in late 2022 and was CEO until mid-2023. For Tesla, Musk's compensation comes entirely from stock awards. Under the plan created in 2018, Musk earned 304 million stock option awards (split-adjusted, at a price of 23.34 per share) in 12 tranches based on meeting revenue, EBITDA, and market capitalization targets, which was completed by the end of 2022. This compensation package was voided by a Delaware judge following a shareholder lawsuit, though Tesla may appeal the ruling. For future compensation awards, while we understand the revenue and EBITDA targets for a growing company, we would prefer a return on invested capital metric be added. Analyst Notes Archive Tesla: Second-Quarter Deliveries Decline Confirms Our View for Lower 2025 Deliveries Seth Goldstein, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,2 Jul 2025 Tesla reported second-quarter deliveries of 384,122 vehicles, a 13 decline versus the second quarter of 2024. Tesla shares were up 5 in premarket trading on the news. Why it matters: A second straight quarter of declining year-over-year deliveries is in line with our forecast for deliveries to decline in 2025. Through the first half of the year, Tesla's deliveries were down 13. The result also supports our view that Tesla's current product lineup is at market saturation. We don't think Tesla will see meaningful deliveries growth without a new lower-cost vehicle aimed at the affordable market. The bottom line: We maintain our 250 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. We view shares as overvalued with the stock trading in 2-star territory. In our view, Tesla's stock continues to reflect optimism for the rollout of the company's robotaxi business and prices in a successful full product launch next year, in line with management's guidance. We agree that robotaxi deserves a higher valuation than new vehicle launches. In our model, we value the robotaxi business higher than the valuation from new vehicle launches. Coming up: Tesla plans to release its earnings on July 23. We hope to hear an update on robotaxi testing and the exact steps to a full launch. We also hope to hear an update on the new affordable vehicle, which management said would launch this year. The robotaxi is in testing, but we view safety precautions, including employees riding in the vehicles, the geofenced testing area, and invite-only access as signs Tesla is still in the early stages. This supports our view that Tesla won't see a full robotaxi launch until 2028. We define a full robotaxi launch as when anyone in the Austin, Texas, Morningstar 2025. All Rights Reserved.

This is consistent with management's long-term vision for the robotaxi product. Tesla: Robotaxi Begins Testing With Non-Tesla Employees but With LimitationsSeth Goldstein, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,23 Jun 2025 On June 22, select Tesla customers began testing the company's robotaxi service. Tesla shares were up slightly in premarket trading on June 23.Why it matters: Non-Tesla employees testing the ride-hailing service is another step toward Tesla's robotaxi product entering commercial service. The test also featured a Tesla ride-hailing app. This supports our view that Tesla will successfully enter the robotaxi ride-hailing market. The test highlighted the improvement needed before Tesla can launch a full robotaxi service. For example, a Tesla employee sat in the passenger seat as a safety monitor. Additionally, the service currently will not test from midnight to 6 a.m. or in the rain. Also, the testing area was limited to a geofenced part of Austin, Texas, roughly half the size of Waymo's operating area. Given that geofencing is not a part of its long-term plan, we view this as a sign that Tesla is still in an earlier testing phase.The bottom line: We maintain our 250 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. We view the shares as overvalued, currently trading a little more than 30 above our fair value estimate and in 2-star territory. We still think it will take longer for Tesla to launch its full commercial service than management's target of 2026. We define full commercial service as when anyone can download the Tesla ride-hailing app and take a non-geofenced ride. We estimate this will occur in 2028.Coming up: Tesla is set to report second-quarter deliveries in early July. Based on April and May data showing a sales decline, we think Tesla is likely to see a second straight quarter of lower deliveries. We expect Tesla will continue to test robotaxis from now until the earnings call in mid- to late July. On the call, we hope to hear an update from management on the key steps for Tesla's path to full robotaxi commercialization. Tesla: Shares Rise as CEO Elon Musk's Feud With US President Donald Trump CoolsSeth Goldstein, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,6 Jun 2025 Elon Musk and Donald Trump's public feud on June 5 appeared to cool off on June 6 with a potential meeting between Musk and Trump aides and Musk saying he would not decommission a spacecraft used for US astronaut space travel. Tesla shares were up 5 at the time of writing. Why it matters: If the feud intensified, Tesla risked facing company-specific repercussions. These could include creating autonomous vehicle regulations unfavorable to Tesla, such as requiring a lidar system or excluding Tesla both from the ability to sell emissions credits and import Chinese rare-earth metals. We view these retaliatory actions as unlikely. In our view, of all Musk's companies, SpaceX is the most at risk for a negative impact from the Musk-Trump feud through the potential cancellation of government contracts. The bottom line: For now, we maintain our 250 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. Even if Musk and Trump return to a cordial relationship, we think Trump will continue to push to end Morningstar 2025. All Rights Reserved.

This would likely weigh on EV sales in 2026. At current prices, we view Tesla as slightly overvalued, with the stock trading around 20 above our fair value estimate but in 3-star territory. We recommend investors wait for the stock to offer a margin of safety before considering an entry point into shares. Big picture: The Musk-Trump relationship will likely increase Tesla's stock price volatility. However, we don't view the relationship as having a large impact on Tesla's business. We see the upcoming robotaxi testing, set to start next week, as a stronger catalyst that will affect Tesla's business and stock price. We also point to the launch of the more affordable vehicle as a key event in 2025. We think the more affordable vehicle will come with a similar price point as best-selling midsize CUVs, such as the Honda CR-V or Toyota Rav4. This should drive deliveries growth as production ramps. Tesla: Shares Sink as CEO Elon Musk Feuds With US President Donald TrumpSeth Goldstein, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,5 Jun 2025 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump publicly feuded with each other, issuing statements on their respective social media platforms. Musk is not in favor of the US budget that Trump hopes to pass. Tesla shares were down over 14 on the day, June 5. Why it matters: The US spending bill includes the expiration of the 7,500 electric vehicle subsidy at the end of 2025, seven years before it is set to expire. All Tesla vehicles sold in the US currently qualify for the subsidy, so Tesla could face lower sales volumes from the subsidy expiration raising prices to consumers. President Trump also threatened to cancel all of Musk's government contracts and subsidies. This would likely affect Musk's SpaceX more than Tesla. However, if Trump were to retaliate against Musk, Tesla might be excluded from the ability to sell emissions credits. The bottom line: For now, we maintain our 250 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. Before June 5's selloff, Tesla was overvalued in 2-star territory. At current prices, we view Tesla as fairly valued, with the stock trading less than 15 above our fair value estimate and in 3-star territory. If the early EV subsidy expiration is enacted into law, it would likely weigh on Tesla's deliveries in 2026. We expect this would affect all EV producers through lower sales volumes, similar to the declines after the removal of EV subsidies in other markets. Longer term, we do not view subsidies as a growth driver of EVs. Once long-range EVs reach cost parity with internal combustion engines and there is adequate fast charging built along highways and throughout cities, consumer demand, not subsidies, will drive EV adoption. Big picture: The subsidy expiration could weigh on Tesla's deliveries in 2026. However, over the long term, we think Tesla's autonomous driving software could prove to be a differentiator that could lead consumers to choose a Tesla.

Tesla shares were up 2 in afterhours trading. Why it matters: Tesla's robotaxi moving from product concept to testing is a key step toward the launch of a robotaxi service. Management said it was targeting the month of June for the testing launch. We interpret the set date as a sign that management is confident the software is ready for testing. The report said Tesla plans to test 10 robotaxis. Based on our estimate for robotaxis making 15 rides per day, this could allow Tesla to run at least 4,500 tests per month, if not more. This should allow Tesla to more quickly identify and fix any issues with the robotaxi service versus a smaller fleet. The bottom line: We maintain our 250 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. While we assume Tesla's robotaxi service begins testing in June, we forecast the multicity robotaxi service launch will not occur until 2028, as we do not think the software is ready for widespread adoption. At current prices, we view Tesla shares as overvalued with the stock trading at roughly 45 above our fair value estimate and in 2-star territory. We see a lot of optimism priced into the stock that implicitly assumes Tesla's robotaxi launches next year, in line with management's timeline. Long view: In the coming years, we forecast Tesla will successfully roll out its robotaxi service and enter new cities. We see Tesla and Alphabet's Waymo gaining market share in the ride-hailing market as they will be able to offer cheaper rides versus traditional ride-hailing services. Tesla: Sales Decline in All Three Key Markets in AprilSeth Goldstein, CFA,Senior Equity Analyst,27 May 2025 The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported Tesla's sales were down nearly 50 in April in the European Union, United Kingdom, and European Free Trade Association countries combined. Tesla shares were up 3 on broader market optimism following a US tariff delay on EU imports. Why it matters: In April, Tesla's sales declined in its three key markets of the US, China, and Europe. This follows a 13 year-over-year deliveries decline in the first quarter. The fall in April sales confirms our view that Tesla will likely see deliveries decline in the second quarter. Lower deliveries reduce Tesla's total addressable market for its ancillary products and services, which include autonomous driving subscription software, charging, and insurance in a select number of US states. The bottom line: For now, we maintain our 250 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Tesla. While we expect second-quarter deliveries will decline, a double-digit drop would put our full-year forecast for Tesla, to see only a low-single-digit decline, at risk. At current prices, we view Tesla shares as overvalued, with the stock trading around 40 above our fair value estimate and in 2-star territory. In our view, the current share price reflects a lot of optimism surrounding the company's ability to launch its robotaxi product. Coming up: Tesla plans to begin testing its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, next month. Management aims to launch the service to customers next year. However, we think the service will likely be delayed until 2028, as we do not think the software will be ready by management's timeline. K Morningstar 2025. All Rights Reserved.
