# EXECUTIVE PROGRAMME
# CAPITAL MARKETS AND SECURITIES LAWS
The Indian Capital market has grown exponentially in terms of resource mobilization, number of listed stocks,
market capitalization, trading volumes, and investors’ base. Along with this growth, the profiles of the investors,
issuers and intermediaries have changed significantly. The market has witnessed a fundamental institutional
change resulting in drastic reduction in transaction costs and significant improvement in efficiency, transparency
and safety. The measures taken by SEBI such as, market determined allocation of resources, rolling settlement,
sophisticated risk management and derivatives trading have greatly improved the framework and efficiency
of trading and settlement, making the Indian capital market qualitatively comparable to many developed markets.
This study material has been published to aid the students in preparing for the Capital Market and Securities
Laws paper of the CS Executive Programme. It is part of the educational kit and takes the students step by step
through each phase of preparation stressing key concepts, pointers and procedures. Company Secretaryship
being a professional course, the examination standards are set very high, with emphasis on knowledge of
concepts, applications, procedures, for which sole reliance on the contents of this study material may not be
enough. Besides, as per the Company Secretaries Regulations, 1982,students are expected to be conversant
with the amendments to the laws made upto six months preceding the date of examination. The material
may, therefore, be regarded as the basic material and must be read alongwith the original Bare Acts, Rules,
Regulations, Academic Guidance etc. This study has been updated upto October, 2017.
The subject of Capital Market and Securities Laws is inherently complicated and is subject to constant refinement
through new primary legislations, rules and regulations made thereunder. It, therefore becomes necessary for
every student to constantly update himself with the various legislative changes made from time to time by
referring to the Institute’s journal ‘Chartered Secretary’ as well as other professional journals.
In the event of any doubt, students may write to the Directorate of Studies for clarification atacademics@icsi.edu.
Although care has been taken in publishing this study material yet the possibility of errors, omissions and/or
discrepancies cannot be ruled out. This publication is released with an understanding that the Institute shall not
be responsible for any errors, omissions and/or discrepancies or any action taken in that behalf.
Should there be any discrepancy, error or omission noted in the study material, the Institute shall be obliged if the same is brought to its notice.
This study material is based on those sections of the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules made there under
which have been notified by the Government of India and came into force w.e.f. April 01, 2014. iii

# INTRODUCTION
Every modern economy is based on a sound financial system which helps in production, capital and economic
growth by encouraging savings habits, mobilising savings from households and other segments and allocating
savings into productive usage such as trade, commerce, manufacture etc.
Financial system covers both credit and cash transactions. All financial transactions are dealt with by cash
payment or issue of negotiable instruments like cheque, bills of exchanges, hundies etc. Thus a financial system
is a set of institutional arrangements through which financial surpluses are mobilised from the units generating
surplus income and transferring them to the others in need of them. The activities include production, distribution,
exchange and holding of financial assets/instruments of different kinds by financial institutions, banks and other
intermediaries of the market. In a nutshell, financial market, financial assets, financial services and financial
institutions constitute the financial system.
Various factors influence the capital market and its growth. These include level of savings in the household
sector, taxation levels, health of economy, corporate performance, industrial trends and common patterns of living.
The strength of the economy is calibrated by different economic indicators like growth in GDP (Gross Domestic
Product), Agricultural production, quantum and spread of rain fall, interest rates, inflation, position on balance of
payments and balance of trade, levels of foreign exchange reserves and investments and growth in capital formation.
The traditional form of financing companies projects consist of internal resources and debt financing, particularly
from financial institutions for modernisation, expansion and diversification. The upsurge in performance of certain
large companies and the astounding increase of their share prices boost the market sentiment to divert the
savings more and more into equity investments in companies. This lead to the growth of equity cult among
investors to contribute resources not only for companies but even for financial institutions and banks.
The functions of a good financial system are manifold. They are: (a) regulation of currency (b) banking functions
```
(c) performance of agency services and custody of cash reserves
```
```
(d) management of national reserves of international currency (e) credit control
```
```
(f) administering national, fiscal and monetary policy to ensure stability of the economy
```
```
(g) supply and deployment of funds for productive use (h) maintaining liquidity.
```
Long term growth of financial system is ensured through: (a) education of investors
```
(b) giving autonomy to FIs to become efficient under competition (c) consolidation through mergers
```
```
(d) facilitating entry of new institutions to add depth to the market
```
```
(e) minimising regulatory measures and market segmentation.

# ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Broadly, organisational structure of financial system includes various components i.e., Financial Markets, Products and Market Participants. Constituents of Financial System  Financial Markets  Products  Market participants
### Financial Markets
Efficient transfer of resources from those having idle resources to others who have a pressing need for them is
achieved through financial markets. Stated formally, financial markets provide channels for allocation of savings
to investment. These provide a variety of assets to savers as well as various forms in which the investors can
raise funds and thereby decouple the acts of saving and investment. The savers and investors are constrained
not by their individual abilities, but by the economy’s ability, to invest and save respectively. The financial markets,
thus, contribute to economic development to the extent that the latter depends on the rates of savings and investment.
The financial markets have two major components; the money market and the capital market.
### Financial Markets
Money Market Capital Market Securities Other forms of Market lending and borrowing
### New Issues Secondary
### Market Markets
### Money Market
The money market refers to the market where borrowers and lenders exchange short-term funds to solve their
liquidity needs. Money market instruments are generally financial claims that have low default risk, maturities under one year and high marketability.
### Capital Market
The Capital Market is a market for financial investments that are direct or indirect claims to capital. It is wider
than the Securities Market and embraces all forms of lending and borrowing, whether or not evidenced by the
creation of a negotiable financial instrument. The Capital Market comprises the complex of institutions and
mechanisms through which intermediate term funds and long term funds are pooled and made available to
business, government and individuals. The Capital Market also encompasses the process by which securities already outstanding are transferred.
The capital market and in particular the stock exchange is referred to as the barometer of the economy.
Government’s policy is so moulded that creation of wealth through products and services is facilitated and

## Page 28

surpluses and profits are channelised into productive uses through capital market operations. Reasonable
opportunities and protection are afforded by the Government through special measures in the capital market to
get new investments from the public and the Institutions and to ensure their liquidity.
# NEED FOR CAPITAL MARKET
Capital market plays an extremely important role in promoting and sustaining the growth of an economy.
– It is an important and efficient conduit to channel and mobilize funds to enterprises, both private and government.
– It provides an effective source of investment in the economy.
– It plays a critical role in mobilizing savings for investment in productive assets, with a view to enhancing
a country’s long-term growth prospects, and thus acts as a major catalyst in transforming the economy
into a more efficient, innovative and competitive marketplace within the global arena.
– In addition to resource allocation, capital markets also provide a medium for risk management by allowing
the diversification of risk in the economy.
– A well-functioning capital market tends to improve information quality as it plays a major role in encouraging
the adoption of stronger corporate governance principles, thus supporting a trading environment, which is founded on integrity.
– Capital market has played a crucial role in supporting periods of technological progress and economic development throughout history.
– Among other things, liquid markets make it possible to obtain financing for capital-intensive projects
with long gestation periods. This certainly held true during the industrial revolution in the 18th century
and continues to apply even as we move towards the so-called “New Economy”.
– Capital markets make it possible for companies to give shares to their employees via ESOPs.
– Capital markets provide a currency for acquisitions via share swaps.
– Capital markets provide an excellent route for disinvestments to take place.
– Venture Capital and Private Equity funds investing in unlisted companies get an exit option when the
company gets listed on the capital markets
– The existence of deep and broad capital market is absolutely crucial in spurring the growth our country.
An essential imperative for India has been to develop its capital market to provide alternative sources of
funding for companies and in doing so, achieve more effective mobilisation of investors’ savings. Capital
market also provides a valuable source of external finance.
For a long time, the Indian market was considered too small to warrant much attention. However, this view has
changed rapidly as vast amounts of both international and domestic investment have poured into our markets
over the last decade. The Indian market is no longer viewed as a static universe but as a constantly evolving one
providing attractive opportunities to the investing community.
# FUNCTIONS OF THE CAPITAL MARKET
The major objectives of capital market are:
– To mobilize resources for investments.
– To facilitate buying and selling of securities.
– To facilitate the process of efficient price discovery.

## Page 29

Lesson 1 Overview of Capital Market 5
– To facilitate settlement of transactions in accordance with the predetermined time schedules.
### Securities Market
The Securities Market, refers to the markets for those financial instruments/claims/obligations that are commonly
and readily transferable by sale. The Securities Market has two inter-dependent and inseparable segments, the
new issues (primary) market and the stock (secondary) market.
### Primary Market
The primary market provides the channel for sale of new securities, while the secondary market deals in securities
previously issued. The issuer of securities sells the securities in the primary market to raise funds for investment and/or to discharge some obligation.
In other words, the market wherein resources are mobilised by companies through issue of new securities is
called the primary market. These resources are required for new projects as well as for existing projects with a
view to expansion, modernisation, diversification and upgradation.
The Primary Market (New Issues) is of great significance to the economy of a country. It is through the primary
market that funds flow for productive purposes from investors to entrepreneurs. The latter use the funds for
creating new products and rendering services to customers in India and abroad. The strength of the economy of
a country is gauged by the activities of the Stock Exchanges. The primary market creates and offers the merchandise for the secondary market.
### Secondary Market
The secondary market enables those who hold securities to adjust their holdings in response to changes in their
assessment of risk and return. They also sell securities for cash to meet their liquidity needs. The price signals,
which subsume all information about the issuer and his business including associated risk generated in the
secondary market, help the primary market in allocation of funds.
Secondary market essentially comprises of stock exchanges which provide platform for purchase and sale of
securities by investors. The trading platform of stock exchanges are accessible only through brokers and trading
of securities is confined only to stock exchanges.
The stock market or secondary market ensures free marketability, negotiability and price discharge. For these
reasons the stock market is referred to as the nerve centre of the capital market, reflecting the economic trend
as well as the hopes, aspirations and apprehensions of the investors.
This secondary market has further two components, First, the spot market where securities are traded for
immediate delivery and payment, The other is futures market where the securities are traded for future
delivery and payment. Another variant is the options market where securities are traded for conditional
future delivery. Generally, two types of options are traded in the options market. A put option permits the
owner to sell a security to the writer of the option at a pre-determined price before a certain date, while a
call option permits the buyer to purchase a security from the writer of the option at a particular price before a certain date. Products and Market Participants
Savings are linked to investments by a variety of intermediaries through a range of complex financial products
called “securities” which is defined in the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 to include shares, scrips,
stocks, bonds, debentures, debenture stock, or other marketable securities of like nature in or of any incorporate
company or body corporate, government securities, derivatives of securities, units of collective investment scheme,
security receipts, interest and rights in securities, or any other instruments so declared by the central government.
There are a set of economic units who demand securities in lieu of funds and others who supply securities for

## Page 30

6 EP-CM&SL
funds. These demand for and supply of securities and funds determine, under competitive market conditions in
goods and securities market, the prices of securities.
It is not that the suppliers of funds and suppliers of securities meet each other and exchange funds for securities.
It is difficult to accomplish such double coincidence of wants. The amount of funds supplied by the supplier of
funds may not be the amount needed by the supplier of securities. Similarly, the risk, liquidity and maturity
characteristics of the securities may not match preference of the supplier of funds. In such cases, they incur
substantial search costs to find each other. Search costs are minimised by the intermediaries who match and
bring these suppliers together. They may act as agents to match the needs of the suppliers of funds / securities,
help them in creation and sale of securities or buy the securities issued by supplier of securities and in turn, sell
their own securities to suppliers of funds. It is, thus, a misnomer that securities market disintermediates by
establishing a direct relationship between the suppliers of funds and suppliers of securities. The market does
not work in a vacuum; it requires services of a large variety of intermediaries like merchant bankers, brokers, etc
to bring the suppliers of funds and suppliers of securities together for a variety of transactions. The disintermediation
in the securities market is in fact an intermediation with a difference; it is a risk-less intermediation, where the
ultimate risks are borne by the suppliers of funds/securities (issuers of securities and investors in securities), and not the intermediaries.
The securities market, thus, has essentially three categories of participants, namely the issuers of securities,
investors in securities and the intermediaries. The issuers and investors are the consumers of services rendered
by the intermediaries while the investors are consumers of securities issued by issuers. Those who receive
funds in exchange for securities and those who receive securities in exchange for funds often need the
reassurance that it is safe to do so. This reassurance is provided by the law and custom, often enforced by the
regulator. The regulator develops fair market practices and regulates the conduct of issuers of securities and
the intermediaries so as to protect the interests of investors in securities. The regulator ensures a high standard
of service from intermediaries and supply of quality securities and non-manipulated demand for them in the market.
# FUNCTIONS OF SECURITIES MARKET
The Securities Market allows people to do more with their savings than they would otherwise could. It also
provides financing that enables people to do more with their ideas and talents than would otherwise be possible.
The people’s savings are matched with the best ideas and talents in the economy. Stated formally, the Securities
Market provides a linkage between the savings and the investment across the entities, time and space. It
mobilises savings and channelises them through securities into preferred enterprises.
The Securities Market also provides a market place for purchase and sale of securities and thereby ensures
transferability of securities, which is the basis for the joint stock enterprise system. The existence of the Securities
Market makes it possible to satisfy simultaneously the needs of the enterprises for capital and the need of investors for liquidity.
Takeaways Securities Market –
 Is a link between investment & savings  Mobilises & channelises savings  Provides Liquidity to investors
 Is a market place for purchase and sale of securities
The liquidity, the market confers and the yield promised or anticipated on security ownership may be sufficiently

Lesson 1 Overview of Capital Market 7
great to attract net savings of income which would otherwise have been consumed. Net savings may also occur
because of other attractive features of security ownership, e.g. the possibility of capital gain or protection of savings against inflation.
A developed Securities Market enables all individuals, no matter how limited their means, to share the
increased wealth provided by competitive private enterprises. The Securities Market allows individuals who
can not carry an activity in its entirety within their resources to invest whatever is individually possible and
preferred in that activity carried on by an enterprise. Conversely, individuals who can not begin an enterprise,
they can attract enough investment from others to make a start. In both cases individuals who contribute to
the investment made in the enterprise share the fruits. The Securities Market, by allowing an individual to
diversify risk among many ventures to offset gains and losses, increases the likelihood of long-term, overall success.
# SECURITIES MARKET AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
A well functioning securities market is conducive to sustained economic growth. There have been a number of
studies, starting from World Bank and IMF to various scholars, which have established robust relationship not
only one way, but also the both ways, between the development in the securities market and the economic
growth. The securities market fosters economic growth to the extent that it-(a) augments the quantities of real
savings and capital formation from any given level of national income, (b) increases net capital inflow from
abroad, (c) raises the productivity of investment by improving allocation of investible funds, and (d) reduces the cost of capital.
It is reasonable to expect savings and capital accumulation and formation to respond favourably to developments
in securities market. The provision of even simple securities decouples individual acts of saving from those of
investment over both time and space and thus allows savings to occur without the need for a concomitant act of
investment. If economic units rely entirely on self-finance, investment is constrained in two ways: by the ability
and willingness of any unit to save, and by its ability and willingness to invest. The unequal distribution of
entrepreneurial talents and risk taking proclivities in any economy means that at one extreme there are some
whose investment plans may be frustrated for want of enough savings, while at the other end, there are those
who do not need to consume all their incomes but who are too inert to save or too cautious to invest the surplus
productively. For the economy as a whole, productive investment may thus fall short of its potential level. In
these circumstances, the securities market provides a bridge between ultimate savers and ultimate investors
and creates the opportunity to put the savings of the cautious at the disposal of the enterprising, thus promising
to raise the total level of investment and hence of growth. The indivisibility or lumpiness of many potentially
profitable but large investments reinforces this argument. These are commonly beyond the financing capacity of
any single economic unit but may be supported if the investor can gather and combine the savings of many.
Moreover, the availability of yield bearing securities makes present consumption more expensive relative to
future consumption and, therefore, people might be induced to consume less today. The composition of savings
may also change with fewer saving being held in the form of idle money or unproductive durable assets, simply
because more divisible and liquid assets are available.
### International Linkage
The securities market facilitates the internationalisation of an economy by linking it with the rest of the world.
This linkage assists through the inflow of capital in the form of portfolio investment. Moreover, a strong domestic
stock market performance forms the basis for well performing domestic corporate to raise capital in the international
market. This implies that the domestic economy is opened up to international competitive pressures, which help
to raise efficiency. It is also very likely that existence of a domestic securities market will deter capital outflow by
providing attractive investment opportunities within domestic economy.

## Page 32

### Improved Investment Allocation
Any financial development produces allocational improvement over a system of segregated investment
opportunities. The benefits of improved investment allocation is such that Mc Kinnon defines economic
development as reduction of the great dispersion in social rate of return to existing and new investments under
domestic entrepreneurial control. Instead of emphasising scarcity of capital, he focuses on the extra-ordinary
distortions commonly found in the domestic securities markets of the developing countries. In the face of great
discrepancies in rate of return, the accumulation of capital does not contribute much to development. A developed
securities market successfully monitors the efficiency with which the existing capital stock is deployed.
Standardised products and reduction in costs
In as much as the securities market enlarges the financial sector, promoting additional and more sophisticated
financing, it increases opportunities for specialisation, division of labour and reductions in costs in financial
activities. The securities market and its institutions help the user in many ways to reduce the cost of capital. They
provide a convenient market place to which investors and issuers of securities go and thereby avoid the need to
search a suitable counterpart. The market provides standardised products and thereby cuts the information
costs associated with individual instruments. The market institutions specialise and operate on large scale
which cuts costs through the use of tested procedures and routines. Developmental benefits
There are also other developmental benefits associated with the existence of a securities market;
## 1. The securities market provides a fast-rate breeding ground for the skills and judgement needed for
entrepreneurship, risk bearing, portfolio selection and management.
## 2. An active securities market serves as an ‘engine’ of general financial development and may, in particular,
accelerate the integration of informal financial systems with the institutional financial sector. Securities
directly displace traditional assets such as gold and stocks of produce or indirectly, may provide portfolio
assets for unit trusts, pension funds and similar FIs that raise savings from the traditional sector.
## 3. The existence of securities market enhances the scope and provides institutional mechanisms, for the
operation of monetary and financial policy.
PROFILE OF SECURITIES MARKET Public and Rights Issues1
Resource mobilisation through primary market, in terms of amount raised, slightly moderated during July 2017
compared to the previous month. Nevertheless, the number of issues remained the same. During the month
under review, the primary market witnessed 15 issues that mobilised Rs. 2,838 crore compared to 15 issues
during June 2017 that mobilised Rs. 5,632 crore. There were 14 public issues that raised Rs. 2,639 crore during

QIP is an alternative mode of resource raising available for listed companies to raise funds from domestic
market. In a QIP, a listed issuer issues equity shares or non-convertible debt instruments along with warrants
and convertible securities other than warrants to Qualified Institutions Buyers only.
There were four QIP issues during July 2017 which raised Rs.2, 775 crore compared to Rs. 15,000 crore raised

out of which the notional value of offshore derivative instruments (including ODIs on derivatives) was Rs. 1,35,297
crore, constituting 4.4 per cent of the total assets under custody of FPIs.
# MARKET REGULATION
It is important to ensure smooth working of capital market, as it is the arena for the players associated with the
economic growth of the country. Various laws have been passed from time to time to meet this objective. The
financial market in India was highly segmented until the initiation of reforms in 1992-93 on account of a variety
of regulations and administered prices including barriers to entry. The reform process was initiated with the
establishment of Securities and Exchange Board of India.
The main legislations governing the Capital Market are:–
## 1. The SEBI Act, 1992 which establishes SEBI to protect investors and develop and regulate securities market.
## 2. The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, SC(R) Act which regulates transactions in securities through control over stock exchanges.

## Page 34

10 EP-CM&SL
## 3. The Depositories Act, 1996 which provides for electronic maintenance and transfer of ownership of demat securities.
## 4. The Companies Act, 2013, which sets out the code of conduct for the corporate sector in relation to
issue, allotment and transfer of securities and disclosures to be made in public issues. SEBI ACT, 1992
The SEBI Act, 1992 establishes SEBI with statutory powers for (a) protecting the interests of investors in securities,
```
(b) promoting the development of the securities market, and (c) regulating the securities market. Its regulatory
```
jurisdiction extends over corporates in the issuance of capital and transfer of securities, in addition to all
intermediaries and persons associated with securities market. It can conduct enquiries, audits and inspection of
all concerned and adjudicate offences under the Act. It has powers to register and regulate all market intermediaries
and also to penalise them in case of violations of the provisions of the Act, Rules and Regulations made there
under. SEBI has full autonomy and authority to regulate and develop an orderly securities market.
SECURITIES CONTRACTS (REGULATION) ACT, 1956
It provides for direct and indirect control of virtually all aspects of securities trading and the running of stock
exchanges and aims to prevent undesirable transactions in securities. It gives central government/SEBI regulatory
jurisdiction over (a) stock exchanges through a process of recognition and continued supervision, (b) contracts
in securities, and (c) listing of securities on stock exchanges. As a condition of recognition, a stock exchange
complies with prescribed conditions of Central Government. Organised trading activity in securities takes place
on a specified recognised stock exchange. The stock exchanges determine their own listing regulations which
have to conform to the minimum listing criteria set out in the Rules. DEPOSITORIES ACT, 1996
The Depositories Act, 1996 provides for the establishment of depositories in securities with the objective of ensuring
free transferability of securities with speed, accuracy and security by (a) making securities of public limited companies
freely transferable subject to certain exceptions; (b) dematerializing the securities in the depository mode; and (c)
providing for maintenance of ownership records in a book entry form. In order to streamline the settlement process,
the Act envisages transfer of ownership of securities electronically by book entry without making the securities
move from person to person. The Act has made the securities of all public limited companies freely transferable,
restricting the company’s right to use discretion in effecting the transfer of securities, and the transfer deed and
other procedural requirements under the Companies Act have been dispensed with. COMPANIES ACT, 2013
The Companies Act, 2013 has replaced the Companies Act, 1956. The Companies Act, 2013 envisage to
strengthen the existing regulatory framework on Corporate Governance. It deals with issue, allotment and transfer
of securities and various aspects relating to company management. It provides for standard of disclosure in
public issues of capital, particularly in the fields of company management and projects, information about other
listed companies under the same management, and management perception of risk factors. It also regulates
underwriting, the use of premium and discounts on issues, rights and bonus issues, payment of interest and
dividends, supply of annual report and other information.
SECURITIES MARKET REFORMS & REGULATORY MEASURES TO PROMOTE INVESTOR
# CONFIDENCE
SEBI has come a long way since its inception as an institution regulating the Indian Capital Markets. It has
initiated a lot of reforms to make the market more safer for investors. The following are the major policy initiatives taken by SEBI since its inception.

## Page 35

Lesson 1 Overview of Capital Market 11
– Control over Issue of Capital: A major initiative of liberalisation was the repeal of the Capital Issues
```
(Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992. In the interest of investors, SEBI issued Disclosure and Investor
```
Protection (DIP) guidelines. The guidelines allow issuers, complying with the eligibility criteria, to issue
securities the securities at market determined rates. The market moved from merit based to disclosure based regulation.
– Establishment of Regulator: A major initiative of regulation was, establishment of a statutory autonomous
agency, called SEBI, to provide reassurance that it is safe to undertake transactions in securities.
– Screen Based Trading: A major developmental initiative was a nation-wide on-line fully-automated
screen based trading system (SBTS) where a member can punch into the computer quantities of securities
and the prices at which he likes to transact and the transaction is executed as soon as it finds a matching sale or buy order from a counter party.
– Risk management: A number of measures were taken to manage the risks in the market so that the
participants are safe and market integrity is protected. The trading cycle varied from 14 days for specified
securities to 30 days for others and settlement took another fortnight. Rolling settlement on T+5 basis
was introduced in phases. All scrips moved to rolling settlement from December 2001. T+5 gave way to
T+3 from April 2002 and T+2 from April 2003.
– Depositories Act: The earlier settlement system gave rise to settlement risk. This was due to the
time taken for settlement and due to the physical movement of paper. Further, the transfer of shares
in favour of the purchaser by the company also consumed considerable amount of time. To obviate
these problems, the Depositories Act, 1996 was passed to provide for the establishment of depositories in securities.
– Derivatives: To assist market participants to manage risks better through hedging, speculation and
arbitrage, SC(R)A was amended in 1995 to lift the ban on options in securities.
– Settlement Guarantee: A variety of measures were taken to address the risk in the market. Clearing
corporations emerged to assume counter party risk. Trade and settlement guarantee funds were set up
to guarantee settlement of trades irrespective of default by brokers. These funds provide full novation
and work as central counter party. The Exchanges /clearing corporations monitor the positions of the
brokers on real time basis. The securities market moved from T+3 settlement period to T+2 rolling
settlement with effect from April 1, 2003. Further, straight through processing has been made mandatory
for all institutional trades executed on the stock exchange.
– Securities Market Awareness: In January 2003, SEBI launched a nation-wide Securities Market
Awareness Campaign that aims at educating investors about the risks associated with the market as
well as the rights and obligations of investors.
– Green Shoe Option- As a stabilization tool for post listing price of newly issued shares, SEBI has
introduced the green shoe option facility in IPOs.
– Securities Lending and Borrowing-A clearing corporation/clearing house, after registration with SEBI,
under the SEBI scheme for Securities Lending and Borrowing, as an approved intermediary, may borrow
securities for meeting shortfalls in settlement, on behalf of the members.
– Corporate Governance - To improve the standards of corporate governance, SEBI amended Clause
49 of the Listing Agreement. The major changes in the new Clause 49 include amendments/additions to
provisions relating to definition of independent directors, strengthening the responsibilities of audit
committees, improving quality of financial disclosures, including those pertaining to related party
transactions and proceeds from public/rights/preferential issues, requiring Boards to adopt formal code
of conduct, requiring CEO/CFO certification of financial statements and improving disclosures to

## Page 36

shareholders. Certain non-mandatory clauses like whistle blower policy and restriction of the term of
independent directors have also been included.

FEATURES OF DEVELOPED CAPITAL MARKET: THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF SECURITIES COMMISSIONS (IOSCO)
# BACKGROUND
The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) was created in 1983 with the decision to
change from an inter-American regional association (created in 1974) into a global cooperative body. Eleven
securities regulatory agencies from North and South America took this decision in April 1983 at a meeting in Quito, Ecuador.
In 1984, securities regulators from France, Indonesia, Korea and the United Kingdom were the first agencies to
join the organization from outside the Americas. The IOSCO Annual Conference in July 1986, held in Paris, was
the first to take place outside of the western hemisphere. It was decided at this meeting to create a permanent General Secretariat for IOSCO.
Today IOSCO is recognized as the international standard setter for securities markets. Its membership regulates
more than 95% of the world’s securities markets and it is the primary international cooperative forum for securities
market regulatory agencies. IOSCO members are drawn from, and regulate, over 100 jurisdictions and its membership continues to grow.
IOSCO provides comprehensive technical assistance to its members, in particular those which regulate emerging securities markets.
In 1998, IOSCO adopted a comprehensive set of Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation (IOSCO
Principles), which is recognized as the international regulatory benchmarks for all securities markets. In 2003,

## Page 39

Lesson 1 Overview of Capital Market 15
the organization endorsed a comprehensive methodology (IOSCO Principles Assessment Methodology) that
enables an objective assessment of the level of implementation of the IOSCO Principles in the jurisdictions of its
members and the development of practical action plans to correct identified deficiencies.
In 2002, IOSCO adopted a multilateral memorandum of understanding (IOSCO MMoU) designed to facilitate
cross-border enforcement and exchange of information among international securities regulators.
Then in 2005, IOSCO endorsed the IOSCO MMoU as the benchmark for international cooperation among
securities regulators and set-out clear strategic objectives to expand the network of IOSCO MMoU signatories
by 2010. It approved as an operational priority the effective implementation - in particular within its
membership - of the IOSCO Principles and of the IOSCO MMoU, which are considered primary instruments
in facilitating cross-border cooperation, reducing global systemic risk, protecting investors and ensuring
fair and efficient securities markets. The Securities and Exchange Board of India is also a signatory to IOSCO MMoU.
# IOSCO OBJECTIVE OF SECURITIES REGULATION
There are three objectives of securities regulation – (i) protecting investors;
```
(ii) ensuring that markets are fair, efficient and transparent; (iii) reducing systemic risk
```
# MEMBERSHIP
# CATEGORIES
There are three categories of membership within IOSCO which are designed to the different approaches to
securities markets regulation while also ensuring that those with an interest in the regulation of securities markets
are also involved in the debate on securities market issues. The three categories are: – Ordinary; – Associate; and – Affiliate.
# ORDINARY
This category is open to a securities commission, or a similar government or statutory regulatory body that has
primary responsibility for securities regulation in its jurisdiction.
If there is no governmental, or statutory, regulatory body in a jurisdiction then a self-regulatory body, such as a
stock exchange, in that jurisdiction is eligible for ordinary membership of IOSCO. However, the ordinary
membership of a self-regulatory body admitted to IOSCO will lapse if a governmental regulatory body from the
same jurisdiction becomes the ordinary member for that jurisdiction.
Ordinary members each have one vote in the Presidents Committee, which meets yearly at the Annual Conference.
# ASSOCIATE
The following bodies can apply to become associate members of the organization:
1. a public regulatory body with jurisdiction in the subdivisions of a jurisdiction if the national regulatory body is already an ordinary member; and

## Page 40

16 EP-CM&SL
1. any other eligible body with an appropriate responsibility for securities regulation.
A self regulatory body is not eligible for associate membership.
Associate members do not have the right to vote and are also precluded from membership of the IOSCO Board;
however they are members of the Presidents Committee.
# AFFILIATE
A self-regulatory body (SRO), or an international body, with an appropriate interest in securities regulation is
eligible for this category of membership.
Affiliate members do not have a vote, are not eligible for the IOSCO Board and are not members of the Presidents
Committee. SROs affiliate members form the SRO Consultative Committee.
# MULTILATERAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CONCERNING CONSULTATION AND
CO-OPERATION AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION (MMoU)
The MMoU sets an international benchmark for cross-border co-operation critical to combating violations of securities and derivatives laws. What is it?
The MMoU represents a common understanding amongst its signatories about how they will consult,
cooperate, and exchange information for securities regulatory enforcement purposes.
The MMoU itself sets out the specific requirements for what information can be exchanged and how it is to be
```
exchanged: legal ability to compel information; types of information that can be compelled; legal ability to share
```
information; and permissible uses of information.
It also sets out specific requirements regarding the confidentiality of the information exchanged, and ensures
that no domestic banking secrecy, blocking laws or regulations prevents securities regulators from sharing this
information with their counterparts in other jurisdictions.
# OVER VIEW OF DEPOSITORY SYSTEM IN INDIA
A depository is an organisation which holds securities (like shares, debentures, bonds, government securities,
mutual fund units etc.) of investors in electronic form at the request of the investors through a registered Depository
Participant. India has adopted the Depository System for securities trading in which book entry is done
electronically and no paper is involved. The physical form of securities is extinguished and shares or securities are held in an electronic form.
# KEY FEATURES OF THE DEPOSITORY SYSTEM IN INDIA
1.Multi-Depository System: The depository model adopted in India provides for a competitive multi-depository
system. There can be various entities providing depository services. A depository should be a company formed
under the Companies Act, 2013 (erstwhile Companies Act, 1956) and should have been granted a certificate of
registration under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. Presently, there are two depositories registered with SEBI, namely:
– National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), and
– Central Depository Service Limited (CDSL)
## 2. Depository services through depository participants: The depositories can provide their services to
investors through their agents called depository participants. These agents are appointed subject to the conditions
prescribed under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 and other applicable conditions.

## Page 41

Lesson 1 Overview of Capital Market 17
3.Dematerialisation:The model adopted in India provides for dematerialisation of securities. This is a significant
step in the direction of achieving a completely paper-free securities market. Dematerialization is a process by
which physical certificates of an investor are converted into electronic form and credited to the account of the depository participant.
4.Fungibility:The securities held in dematerialized form do not bear any notable feature like distinctive number,
folio number or certificate number. Once shares get dematerialized, they lose their identity in terms of share
certificate, distinctive numbers and folio numbers. Thus all securities in the same class are identical and
interchangeable. For example, all equity shares in the class of fully paid up shares are interchangeable.
5.Registered Owner/ Beneficial Owner: In the depository system, the ownership of securities dematerialized
is bifurcated between Registered Owner and Beneficial Owner. According to the Depositories Act, 1996 ‘Registered
Owner’ means a depository whose name is entered as such in the register of the issuer. A ‘Beneficial Owner’
means a person whose name is recorded as such with the depository. Though the securities are registered in
the name of the depository actually holding them, the rights, benefits and liabilities in respect of the securities
held by the depository remain with the beneficial owner. For the securities dematerialized, NSDL/CDSL is the
Registered Owner in the books of the issuer; but ownership rights and liabilities rest with Beneficial Owner. All
the rights, duties and liabilities underlying the security are on the beneficial owner of the security.
## 6. Free Transferability of shares: Transfer of shares held in dematerialized form takes place freely through electronic book-entry system.

Cumulative preference shares where the preference dividend gets accumulated for being paid subsequently if
the company does not have adequate profits. Such arrears of dividend need to be paid in subsequent years before payment of equity dividends. NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERENCE SHARES
In the case of these preference shares, dividend does not accumulate. If there are no profits or the profits are
inadequate in any year, the shares are not entitled to any dividend for that year. Unless there is a specific
provision in the Articles of Association of the company, the preference shareholders have no right to participate
in the surplus profits or in the surplus assets in a winding up. RBI also allowed Indian banks to issue these types
of preference shares as capital under Basel III capital regulations.
# CONVERTIBLE PREFERENCE SHARES
If the terms of issue of preference shares includes a right for converting them into equity shares at the end of a
specified period they are called convertible preference shares. In the absence of such condition or right, the
preference shares are not converted into equity shares to become eligible for various rights such as voting,
higher dividend, bonus issue etc. as in the case of equity shares. These shares are some times referred to as quasi equity shares in common parlance.
# REDEEMABLE PREFERENCE SHARES
These are such preference shares in which are redeemed after specific period and money is returned to
shareholders. According to Section 55 of the Companies Act, 2013, a Company cannot issue preference shares
which are irredeemable. If Article of association permits, the Company can issue preference shares which are
redeemable not later than 20 years. Companies engaged in infrastructure projects can issue shares redeemable
exceeding 20 years subject to condition mentioned in rule 9 and 10 of the Companies (Share Capital and Debenture) Rules, 2014.
# PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE SHARES
Preference shareholders are not entitled to dividend more than what has been indicated as part of the terms of
issue, even in a year in which the company has made huge profits. Subject to provision in the terms of issue
these shares can be entitled to participate in the surplus profits left, after payment of dividend to the preference
and the equity shareholders to the extent provided therein. Subject to provisions in the terms of issue such
preference shares can be entitled even to bonus shares.

# NON PARTICIPATING PREFERENCE SHARES
Unless the terms of issue indicate specifically otherwise, all preference shares are to be regarded as non- participating preference shares.
FULLY CONVERTIBLE CUMULATIVE PREFERENCE SHARE (EQUIPREF)
This instrument is in two parts A & B. Part A is convertible into equity shares automatically and compulsorily on
the date of allotment without any application by the allottee, and Part B is redeemed at par/ converted into equity
after a lock in period at the option of the investor, at a price 30% lower than the average market price. The
dividend is given only for part B shares.
# DEBENTURES
Section 2(30) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines debentures. “Debenture” includes debenture stock, bonds or
any other instrument of a company evidencing a debt, whether constituting a charge on the assets of the company or not;
Debenture is a document evidencing a debt or acknowledging it and any document which fulfills either of these conditions is a debenture.
The important features of a debenture are:
## 1. It is issued by a company as a certificate of indebtedness.
## 2. It usually indicates the date of redemption and also provides for the repayment of principal and payment of interest at specified date or dates.
## 3. It usually creates a charge on the undertaking or the assets of the company. In such a case the lenders
of money to the company enjoy better protection as secured creditors, i.e. if the company does not pay
interest or repay principal amount, the lenders may either directly or through the debenture trustees
bring action against the company to realise their dues by sale of the assets/undertaking earmarked as security for the debt.
## 4. Debentures holders does not have any voting rights.
## 5. Compulsory payment of interest. The interest on debenture is payable irrespective of whether there are profits made or not.
# TYPES OF DEBENTURES
Naked or unsecured Debentures of this kind do not carry any charge on the assets of the debentures company.
Secured debentures Debentures that are secured by a mortgage of the whole or part of the
assets of the company are called mortgage debentures or secured debentures.
Redeemable debentures Debentures that are redeemable on expiry of certain period are called redeemable debentures.
Perpetual debentures If the debentures are issued subject to redemption on the happening of
specified events which may not happen for an indefinite period, e.g.
winding up, they are called perpetual debentures.
Bearer debentures Such debentures are payable to bearer and are transferable by mere delivery.

Registered debentures Such debentures are payable to the registered holders whose name
appears on the debenture certificate/ letter of allotment and is registered
on the companies register of debenture holders maintained as per
Section 88(1)(b) of the Companies Act, 2013.
# CATEGORIES OF DEBENTURES
Based on convertibility, debentures can be classified under three categories:
## 1. Fully Convertible Debentures (FCDs)
## 2. Non Convertible Debentures (NCDs)
## 3. Partly Convertible Debentures (PCDs)
# FULLY CONVERTIBLEDEBENTURES
These are converted into equity shares of the company with or without premium as per the terms of the issue, on
the expiry of specified period or periods. If the conversion is to take place at or after eighteen months from the
date of allotment but before 36 months, the conversion is optional on the part of the debenture holders in terms
of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations. Interest will be payable on these debentures upto the date of conversion as per transfer issue. NON CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES (NCDs)
These debentures do not carry the option of conversion into equity shares and are therefore redeemed on the
expiry of the specified period or periods. PARTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES (PCDs)
These may consist of two kinds namely -convertible and non-convertible. The convertible portion is to be converted
into equity shares at the expiry of specified period. However, the non convertible portion is redeemed at the
expiry of the stipulated period. If the conversion takes place at or after 18 months, the conversion is optional at the discretion of the debenture holder.
# BASIC FEATURES OF CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
- Debentures are issued for cash at par.
- They are converted into specified or unspecified number of equity shares at the end of the specified
period. The ratio at which the convertible debentures are exchanged for equity shares is known as
conversion price or conversion ratio which is worked out by dividing the face value of a convertible
debenture by its conversion price. For instance if the face value of a convertible debenture is` 100 and
it is convertible into two equity shares, the conversion price is ` 50 and the conversion ratio is 2. The
difference between the conversion price and the face value of the equity share is called conversion premium.
- Convertible debentures may be fully or partly convertible. In case it is fully convertible the entire face
value is converted into equity shares on expiry of the stipulated period. If partly convertible, the convertible
portion is converted into equity shares on expiry of the specified period and the non convertible portion
is redeemed at the expiry of certain period.
- Conversion into equity shares may take place in one or more stages at the end of specified period or
periods in the case of fully or partly convertible debentures.
- If one or more parts of the debentures are convertible after 18 months, a company should get a credit

rating done by a credit rating agency approved by SEBI. Fresh rating is required if debentures are rolled over.
- Convertible debentures of public companies are listed on the stock exchanges to assure liquidity to the
holders. However, even today debt instruments are not actively traded in Indian stock exchanges.
# ADVANTAGES OF CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
The advantages of convertible debentures to the company are –
## 1. Capitalisation of interest cost till the date of commissioning of the project is allowed in accordance with
accounting principle. If the conversion of the debentures is duly linked with the commissioning of the
project the entire interest cost can be capitalised, without charging the interest to profit & loss account
and pulling down the profits of the company.
## 2. Convertible debentures carry lower interest as compared to the rate charged by the Banks and Financial Institutions.
## 3. From the point of view of the debt equity ratio the convertible part of the debentures is treated as equity
by financial institutions. The company is thus enabled to have a high degree of flexibility in financing its future projects.
## 4. Equity capital gets increased after each conversion, facilitating easier servicing of equity by payment of dividend.
## 5. Tax benefits are higher as interest on debentures is allowed as a deduction in computation of taxable
income of the company. Additionally a company having a proven track record and future earning potential
will be able to charge reasonable premium at the time of conversion.
## 6. In the case of term loans from FIs and Banks they usually impose many conditions on management
including placing their representative on the board. In the case of convertible debentures there is thus a
greater degree of autonomy for the companies.
The advantages of the convertible debentures to the investors are –
## 1. The investor is assured of a fixed return by way of interest on the debentures till conversion. On conversion
into equity the investor becomes entitled to receive dividend declared on equity shares. The advantage
to the investor is that he receives a fixed return on his investment by way of interest even during the
gestation period and project implementation period.
## 2. As price of equity shares tends to rise on completion of the project of the company, the investor gets
value appreciation on his investment, if converted into equity.
## 3. In most cases, debentures carry security with a charge on all or a part of movable/immovable properties
of the company. This assures prompt payment of principal and interest by invoking the assistance of a
debenture trustee. However in terms of SEBI Regulations where the debentures have a maturity period
of 18 months or less it is mandatory for the company to create security on the debentures.
## 4. A fair amount of liquidity is enjoyed by convertible debentures listed on the stock exchanges depending
on the track record of the companies. Even if debentures are not traded as actively as equity shares,
convertible debentures of good companies command reasonable liquidity. Where a debenture has
several parts, each part of the convertible debentures can be traded separately or in full on the stock exchanges.
## 5. The following options are available to the investor who has bought convertible debentures issued in several parts:

## Page 51

Lesson 2 Capital Market Instrumentss 27
```
(a) To sell all the parts immediately on allotment;
```
```
(b) To sell one or more parts and retain other or others till conversion and to obtain equity shares for retention or sale.
```
# DISTINCTION BETWEEN FULLY CONVERTIBLE AND PARTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
Characteristics Partly convertible debentures Fully convertible debentures
Suitability Better suited for companies with Better suited for companies without
established track record established track record
Capital base Relatively lower equity capital on Higher equity capital on conversion of conversion of debentures debentures
Flexibility in financing Favourable debt equity ratio Highly favourable debt equity ratio
Classification for debt- Convertible portion classified as ‘equity’ Classified as equity for debt-equity
equity ratio computation and non-convertible portion as ‘debt’ computation
Popularity Not so popular with investors Highly popular with investors
Servicing of equity Relatively lesser burden of equity Higher burden of servicing of equity servicing
In the case of partly convertible debentures, debenture redemption reserve has to be created for 50% of the
face value of the non-convertible portion. The facility of buy-back is also permissible in respect of non-convertible portion of debentures.
In contrast no reserve for debenture redemption is required for fully convertible debentures nor are buy-back arrangements permissible.
Sometimes companies issue zero interest fully convertible debentures. In this case, investors are not paid any
interest till the date of conversion or upto the notified date, after which they are converted into shares. For the
investor the investment amount is lower and cost of conversion also is less. Further this helps them as a means
of tax planning since interest which is otherwise taxable is not paid. The capital appreciation at the time of
conversion is treated as capital gains where tax rate is less. Companies also prefer this instrument because
they are able to avoid payment of interest.
FULLY CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES WITH INTEREST (OPTIONAL)
In this case there is no interest payment involved say for the first 6 months. Then the holder can exercise option
and apply for securities at a premium without paying additional amount. However interest will be payable at a
determined rate from the date of first conversion to second/final conversion and in lieu thereof equity shares are issued.
Upon conversion of each part, the face value stands reduced proportionately on the date of conversion.
# SWEAT EQUITY SHARES
Section 2 (88) of the Companies Act, 2013 defines “sweat equity shares” means such equity shares as are
issued by a company to its directors or employees at a discount or for consideration, other than cash, for
providing their know-how or making available rights in the nature of intellectual property rights or value additions, by whatever name called.
| Characteristics | Partly convertible debentures | Fully convertible debentures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Suitability | Better suited for companies with
established track record | Better suited for companies without

## Page 52

28 EP-CM&SL
Company issue shares at a discount or for consideration other than cash to selected employees and directors
as per norms approved by the Board of Directors or any committee, like compensation committee, formed for
this purpose. This is based on the know how provided or intellectual property rights created and given for value
additions made by such directors and employees to the company.
It may be noted that the intellectual property right, know how or value additions arise as of now mainly in the
case of Information Technology related companies and Pharmaceutical companies. Categories of industries
which are eligible to issue sweat equity shares have not been indicated by the Government either in the Act or otherwise.
According to Section 54 of the Companies Act, 2013 a company may issue sweat equity shares of a class of
shares already issued, if the following conditions are fulfilled:
```
(a) The issue is authorized by a special resolution passed by the company in the general meeting.
```
```
(b) The resolution specifies the number of shares, current market price, consideration if any and the class
```
or classes of directors or employees to whom such equity shares are to be issued.
```
(c) Not less than one year has elapsed at the date of the issue, since the date on which the company was entitled to commence business.
```
```
(d) The sweat equity shares of a company whose equity shares are listed on a recognised stock exchange
```
are issued in accordance with the regulations made by SEBI in this regard and if they are not listed the
sweat equity shares are to be issued in accordance with the rule 8 of Companies (Share Capital and Debenture) Rules, 2014.
# SECURED PREMIUM NOTES
These instruments are issued with detachable warrants and are redeemable after a notified period say 4 to 7
years. The warrants enable the holder to get equity shares allotted provided the secured premium notes are fully
paid. It combines the feature of both debt and equity. During the lock in period no interest is paid. The holder has
an option to sell back the SPN to the company at par value after the lock in period. If the holder exercises this
option, no interest/premium is paid on redemption. In case the holder keeps it further, he is repaid the principal
amount along with the additional interest/premium on redemption in installments as per the terms of issue. The
conversion of detachable warrants into equity has to be done within the specified time. TISCO took the lead in
July, 1992 by making a mega rights issue of equity shares and secured premium notes aggregating to ` 1,212 crores.
The terms of the SPN were so formulated that the return on investment was treated as capital gain and not
regular income. Consequently, the rate of tax applicable was lower.
# EQUITY SHARES WITH DETACHABLE WARRANTS
The holder of the warrant is eligible to apply for the specified number of shares on the appointed date at the pre-
determined price. These warrants are separately registered with the stock exchanges and traded separately.
The practice of issuing non convertible debentures with detachable warrants also exists in the Indian market.
# DUAL OPTION WARRANTS
Dual option warrants are designed to provide the buyer with good potential of capital appreciation and limited
downside risk. Dual option warrants may be used to sell equity shares in different markets. For example, equity
shares or debentures may be issued with two warrants - one warrant giving right to the purchaser to be allotted
one equity share at the end of a certain period and another warrant with a debt or preference share option.

## Page 53

Lesson 2 Capital Market Instrumentss 29
# DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH DEBT WARRANTS
Debt instruments may be issued with debt warrants which give the holder the option to invest in additional debt
on the same terms within the period specified in the warrant. This instrument is beneficial to the investors in
periods of falling interest rates when the holder can exercise the debt warrant option and hold additional debt at, interest rates above market rates.
# DEBT FOR EQUITY SWAP
These instruments give an offer to the debt holders to exchange the debt for equity shares of the company.
The issuers offering debt for equity swaps are interested in increasing equity capital by improving their debt-
equity ratios and enhancing their debt issuing capacity. They reduce their interest burden and replace it with
dividend burden which is payable at the discretion of the issuer. However, the issuer faces the risk of dilution of
earnings per share by a sharp rise in the equity. In addition, dividends are not tax deductible.
From the investors’ point of view, there is potential gain from rise in the value of the equity shares. The potential
rise in price of equity shares may or may not materialize.
Variations of this instrument are mortgage backed securities that split the monthly payment from underlying
mortgages into two parts -each receiving a specified portion of the principal payments and a different specified portion of the interest payments.
# INDEXED RATE NOTES
In indexed rate notes, the interest rate fixation is postponed till the actual date of placement, rather than fixing it
on the date of the commitment. The interest rate is computed on the date of take down at the prevailing private
placement rates, using a formula based on the index such as the 182 days treasury bill yield rates. These
instruments are beneficial to a company in a high interest rate environment, if the interest rates are expected to
decline between the date of commitment and the date of take down.
# EXTENDABLE NOTES
Extendable notes are issued for 10 years with flexibility to the issuer to review the interest rate every two years.
The interest rate is adjusted every two years to reflect the prevailing market conditions by trying the interest rate
to a spread over a bond index such as two years treasury notes. Depending on the specific terms of the extendable
bond, the bond holder and/or bond issuer may have one or more opportunities to defer the repayment of the
bond's principal, during which time interest payments continue to be paid. Additionally, the bond holder or issuer
may have the option to exchange the bond for one with a longer maturity, at an equal or higher rate of interest.
Because these bonds contain an option to extend the maturity period, a feature that adds value to the bond,
extendable bonds sell at a higher price than non-extendable bonds
# LEVEL PAY FLOATING RATE
Level pay floating rate notes are issued for a long period of time say 20 years, with adjustment in interest rate
every five years. These notes provide for level payments for time intervals during the term of the note, with
periodic interest adjustments tied to an index, and adjustments to the principal balance to reflect the difference
between the portion of the payment allocable to interest and the amount of floating rate interest actually
incurred. Maximum limits on upward adjustments to principal are specified at the outset to protect the lender
from runaway floating exposure. The level pay note has the advantage to the issuer of having a predictable
level of debt service for a period of years, thereby avoiding the uncertainties of floating debt on cash flows during that time.

# ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE NOTES
These are debt convertible into equity shares of the issuer. If investors choose to convert, they forgo all the
accrued and unpaid interest. These convertibles are generally issued with put option to the investors. The
advantage to the issuer is the raising of convertible debt without heavy dilution of equity. Since the investors give
up acquired interest by exercise of conversion option, the conversion option may not be exercised by many investors.
The investor gains in the event of appreciation in the value of the equity shares. Even if the appreciation does
not materialize, the investor has the benefit of a steady stream of implied income. If the instrument is issued with
put option, the investor can resell the securities to the investor.
# DEEP DISCOUNT BOND
IDBI and SIDBI had issued this instrument. For a deep discount price of` 2,700/- in IDBI the investor got a bond
with the face value of ` 1,00,000. The bond appreciates to its face value over the maturity period of 25 years.
Alternatively, the investor can withdraw from the investment periodically after 5 years. The capital appreciation
is charged to tax at capital gains rate which is lower than normal income tax rate. The deep discount bond is
considered a safe, solid and liquid instrument and assigned the best rating by CRISIL.
# DISASTER BONDS
These are issued by companies and institutions to share the risk and expand the capital to link investors return
with the size of insurer losses. The bigger the losses, the smaller the return and vice-versa. The coupon rate and
the principal of the bonds are decided by the occurrence of the casualty of disaster and by the possibility of borrower defaults.
# OPTION BONDS
This instrument covers those cumulative and non-cumulative bonds where interest is payable on maturity or
periodically and redemption premium is offered to attract investors.
# EASY EXIT BONDS
This instrument covers both bonds which provide liquidity and an easy exit route to the investor by way of
redemption or buy back where investors can get ready encashment in case of need to withdraw before maturity.
# PAY IN KIND BONDS
This refers to bonds wherein interest for the first three to five years is paid through issue of additional bonds,
which are called baby bonds as they are derived from parent bond.
# SPLIT COUPON DEBENTURES
This instrument is issued at a discounted price and interest accrues in the first two years for subsequent payment
in cash. This instrument helps better management of cash outflows in a new project depending upon cash generating capacity.
# FLOATING RATE BONDSAND NOTES
In this case interest is not fixed and is allowed to float depending upon market conditions. This instrument is
used by the issuers to hedge themselves against the volatility in interest rates.
Some of the above instruments have been used selectively by companies and institutions recently to raise funds.

## Page 55

Lesson 2 Capital Market Instrumentss 31
# CLIPAND STRIP BONDS
Clip and strip bonds also referred to as coupon notes, split the principal and coupon portions of a bond issue and
two separate coupon instruments are sold to the investors.
In structuring a coupon note issue, a conventional current coupon bond is sold to the investor. The streams of
coupon payments are stripped away and the principal amount of bond is sold as a deep discount bond. The gain
to the investor is difference between the purchase price and the par value. The coupon streams are sold like
zero coupon bonds where the investor pays discount for it and receives the payment at a lower rate.
# DUAL CONVERTIBLE BONDS
A dual convertible bond is convertible into either equity shares or fixed interest rate debentures/preference
shares at the option of the lender. Depending on the prospects of the project during the conversion period, the
lender may exercise either of the options. The fixed interest rate debenture may have certain additional features
including higher rate of interest distinct from the original debt instrument.
# STEPPED COUPON BONDS
Under stepped coupon bonds, the interest rate is stepped up or down during the tenure of the bond. The main
advantage to the investor is the attraction of higher rate of interest in case of general rise in interest rates.
# INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS
Industrial revenue bonds are issued by financial institutions in connection with the development or purchase of
industrial facilities. These may become attractive if certain income-tax and wealth-tax concessions are offered.
The bond proceeds could be used to purchase or a construct facilities which are subsequently leased or sold to
the company. The institution acts as a conduit of funds between the lenders and the company in order to take
advantage of tax benefits enjoyed by the institutions.
# COMMODITY BONDS
Commodity bonds are bonds issued to share the risk and profitability of future commodity prices with the investor.
For example, petro bonds, silver bonds, gold bonds and coal bonds.
A petro bond may carry a fixed rate of interest with part of the face value of the bonds denominated in barrels of
oil. There would be a floor in the face value of the bond. In view of the upside profit potential in oil prices, the
interest rate could be lower than the market rate of interest. These bonds may be issued for decontrolled items.
# CARROTAND STICK BOND
Another variation of the above instrument is the carrot and stick bond. The carrot is the lower than normal
conversion premium i.e. the premium over the present market price of the equity shares is fixed at a reasonable
level so that the price of the equity shares need not increase significantly to make conversion practical. The stick
is the issuer’s right to call the issue at a specified premium if the price of the equity shares is traded above a
specified percentage of the conversion price.
# CAPITAL INDEXED BONDS
Capital indexed bonds are inflation-protection securities. Such bonds, therefore, provide good hedge against
inflation risk. The benefits do extend beyond hedging. Capital index bonds can be used as a market indicator for
inflation expectation. This will help investors take a more intelligent decision on their current consumption.
Finally, the spot yield curve can be better constructed based on the real yields.
Inflation risk: A nominal bond is exposed to high inflation risk. This is the risk that inflation will increase, leading
to increase in interest rate. Essentially then, inflation risk is a sub-component of interest rate risk. A capital

## Page 56

32 EP-CM&SL
indexed bonds lowers the interest rate risk by neutralizing the inflation risk.
The effectiveness of the hedge will, however, depend on the appropriateness of the inflation index. The purpose
of issuing capital indexed bonds will not be fully served if the RBI were to use the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
or the Retail Price Index (RPI) as the index for inflation. The reason is that these indices do not adequately
capture inflation as it affects the investors, especially the retail class.
If banks are protected against inflation risk, they may, perhaps, pass on the benefits in the form of higher interest
rate to the retail investors. That, in turn, provides retail investors a higher cushion against inflation risk. In such
cases, more the inflation index is aligned to price levels affecting retail consumption, better the hedge.
Inflation expectation: Investors buy bonds by postponing their current consumption. There is, therefore, a trade-
off between investment and consumption. To make an intelligent decision between these two states of nature,
investors need an indicator to measure inflation expectations. At present, due to lack of adequate measures, we
assume that inflation expectation is the same as current inflation. If actual inflation were higher in the future, the
investment decision may be unattractive. It is, therefore, important to proxy inflation expectation. A capital indexed bond helps in this regard.
If the RBI were to issue capital indexed bonds across the yield curve, we will have real yields for each maturity
sector. We already have nominal yields as well for these sectors. The difference between the nominal and the
real yields is a proxy for inflation expectation.
# INFLATION INDEXED BONDS OR INFLATION INDEXED NATIONAL SAVINGS SECURITIES
India recently launched a new kind of bond to give individual investors some protection against inflation. The
new bonds, officially called the Inflation Indexed National Savings Securities.
Unlike a traditional bond where the interest rate is fixed, in the inflation-linked bonds, the government will pay an
interest of 1.5% per year above the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
The interest rate will be reset every six months, to reflect any changes in inflation.
These bonds aren’t a great deal for investors who are in higher income-tax brackets, because the interest on the
bonds is taxable as income. After taxes, the returns on these bonds will be lower than inflation.
# TAX FREE BONDS
Specified Companies issue Tax free bonds. The interest paid on this bonds are tax free in the hand of investor.
# GLOBAL DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS
According to Section 2 (44) of the Companies Act, 2013 “Global Depository Receipt” means any instrument in
the form of a depository receipt, by whatever name called, created by a foreign depository outside India and
authorised by a company making an issue of such depository receipts;
Section 41 of the Companies Act, 2013 authorizes a company to issue Global Depository Receipts after following
the conditions as prescribed in Companies (Issue of Global Depository Receipts) Rules, 2014.
It is a form of depository receipt or certificate created by the Overseas Depository Bank outside India denominated
in dollar and issued to non-resident investors against the issue of ordinary shares or foreign currency convertible
bonds of issuing company. In simple words, it is basically a negotiable instrument denominated in US dollars. It
is traded in Europe or the US or both. After getting approval from the Ministry of Finance and completing other
formalities, a company issues rupee denominated shares in the name of depository which delivers these shares
to its local custodian bank, the holder on records, thus depository. The depository then issues dollar denominated
depository receipts (or GDR) against the shares registered with it. Generally one GDR is equivalent to one or
more (rupee denominated) shares. It is traded like any other dollar denominated security in the foreign markets,

## Page 57

Lesson 2 Capital Market Instrumentss 33
in addition to equity financing (as GDR represents equity) over debt financing. GDR issue also possesses merits
like less issue formalities, less administrative works as regards dividend payment, information dissemination,
annual general meeting etc. as the issuer deal only with a single shareholder, the depository; easy availability of
foreign exchange and no foreign exchange risk. Besides issuing companies, foreign investors especially FIIs
also get advantage of investing in the Indian companies without getting registration with SEBI, relief from
cumbersome settlement and delivery procedures, adequate liquidity (as GDR is as liquid as the shares of the
company in its home market) and generally higher returns. In fact, GDR holders enjoy all economic benefits of
the underlying shares but have none of the corporate rights like right to vote.
FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERTIBLE BOND (FCCB)
A Foreign Currency Convertible Bond (FCCB) is a quasi debt instrument which is issued by any corporate entity,
international agency or sovereign state to the investors all over the world. They are denominated in any freely
convertible foreign currency. Euro Convertible Bonds are usually issued as unsecured obligation of the borrowers.
FCCBs represent equity linked debt security which can be converted into shares or into depository receipts. The
investors of FCCBs has the option to convert it into equity normally in accordance with pre-determined formula
and sometimes also at a pre-determined exchange rate. The investor also has the option to retain the bond. The
FCCBs by virtue of convertibility offers to issuer a privilege of lower interest cost than that of similar non convertible
debt instrument. By issuing these bonds, a company can also avoid any dilution in earnings per share that a
further issue of equity might cause whereas such a security still can be traded on the basis of underlying equity
value. The agreement providing for the issuance of FCCBs normally carry less restrictive covenants as they
relate to the issuer. Further, FCCBs can be marketed conveniently and the issuer company can expect that the
number of its shares will not increase until investors see improved earnings and prices for its common stock.
Like GDRs, FCCBs are also freely tradeable and the issuer has no control over the transfer mechanism and
cannot be even aware of ultimate beneficiary. The Finance Ministry vide Notification dated 20.6.1994 stated that
w.e.f. this date FCCBs will be considered an approved instrument of accessing external commercial borrowings.
The terms and conditions normally applicable to commercial borrowing would be binding on convertible bonds.
This would include restrictions on end-use, import of capital goods and minimum maturity for bonds. Priority for

According to Section 2(48) of the Companies Act, 2013 “Indian Depository Receipt” means any instrument in the
form of a depository receipt created by a domestic depository in India and authorised by a company incorporated
outside India making an issue of such depository receipts;
Section 390 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rule 13 of Companies (Registration of Foreign Companies) Rules,
2014 lays down the procedure for issue of Indian Depository Receipts.
Apart from this a company has to comply with Chapter X and XA of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 to issue IDRs or a rights issue of IDRs.
An IDR is an instrument denominated in Indian Rupee in the form of a depository receipt created by a domestic
depository (Custodian of securities registered with SEBI) against the underlying equity of issuing company to
enable foreign companies to raise funds from Indian Securities Markets.
In an IDR, foreign companies would issue shares, to a domestic (Indian) depository, which would in turn issue
depository receipts to investors in India. The actual shares underlying the IDRs would be held by an Overseas
Custodian, which shall authorize the Indian depository to issue the IDRs. To that extent, IDRs are derivative
instruments because they derive their value from the underlying shares. Standard Chartered PLC is only company to offer IDR in the Indian market.

Issuing Companies: Any foreign company listed in its home country and satisfying the eligibility criteria can issue
IDRs. A company which has significant businesses in India can increase its value through IDRs by breaking
down market segmentations, reaching trapped pools of liquidity, achieving international shareholder base and
improving its brand’s presence through global visibility.

Investors: IDRs can lead to better portfolio management and diversification for investor by giving them a chance

to buy into the stocks of reputed companies abroad.
# TRACKING STOCKS
A Tracking stock is a type of common stock that “tracks” or depends on the financial performance of a specific
business unit or operating division of a company, rather than the operations of the company as a whole. As a
result, if the unit or division performs well, the value of the tracking stocks may increase, even if the company’s
performance as a whole is not up to mark or satisfactory. The opposite may also be true.
A tracking stock is a special type of stock issued by a publicly held company to track the value of one segment
of that company. By issuing a tracking stock, the different segments of the company can be valued differently by
investors. Tracking stocks are generally issued by a parent company in order to create a financial vehicle that
tracks the performance of a particular division or subsidiary. When a parent company issues a tracking stock, all
revenues and expenses of the applicable division are separated from the parent company’s financial statements
and bound to the tracking stock. Often this is done to separate a high-growth division from large losses shown
by the financial statements of the parent company. The parent company and its shareholders, however, still control operations of the subsidiary.
Tracking stock carries dividend rights tied to the performance of a targeted division without transferring ownership
or control over divisional assets. In contrast to a spin-off or an equity carve-out, the parent retains full control,
allowing it to enjoy any operating synergies, or economies of scale in administration or finance.
Shareholders of tracking stocks have a financial interest only in that unit or division of the company. Unlike the
common stock of the company itself, a tracking stock usually has limited or no voting rights. In the event of a
company’s liquidation, tracking stock shareholders typically do not have a legal claim on the company’s assets.
If a tracking stock pays dividends, the amounts paid depends on the performance of the business unit or division.
But not all tracking stocks pay dividends.
A company has many good reasons to issue a tracking stock for one of its subsidiaries (as opposed to spinning it off to shareholders).
```
(i) First, the company keeps control over the subsidiary (although they don’t get all the profit), but all
```
revenues and expenses of the division are separated from the parent company’s financial statements
and attributed to tracking stock. This is often done to separate a high growth division with large losses
from the financial statements of the parent company.
```
(ii) Second, they might be able to lower their costs of obtaining capital by getting a better credit rating.
```
```
(iii) Third, the businesses can share marketing, administrative support functions, etc.
```
```
(iv) Finally, if the tracking stock shoots up, the parent company can make acquisitions and pay in stock of subsidiary instead of cash.
```
When a tracking stock is issued, the company can choose to sell it to the markets (i.e., via an initial public
offering) or to distribute new shares to existing shareholders. Either way, the newly tracked business segment
gets a longer lease, but can still run back to the parent company in tough times.

Lesson 2 Capital Market Instrumentss 35
# ADVANTAGES OF TRACKING STOCK
A key advantage of tracking stock is that it offers divisional managers a degree of decision-making authority that
might otherwise be unattainable, given top management’s reluctance to dilute its control over the division’s
assets. The practical effect should be to enhance job satisfaction for divisional managers, thus reducing retention
risk and also increasing the company’s responsiveness to changing market conditions. Also, investors have
more direct access to the specific businesses of the parent, which can be highly useful in the case of a diversified
company. Another possible reason for the growing popularity of trackers is that trackers allow mainstream
companies to exploit the dual stock market pricing between conventional and high-tech or Internet businesses.
By creating tracked business units, conventional businesses too can benefit from the pricing frenzy.
# DISADVANTAGES OF TRACKING STOCK
For investors, tracking stocks can be of a mixed bag. Like regular stocks, tracking stockholders are entitled to
dividends paid out by the subsidiaries issuing the tracking stock. Yet the holders of tracking stocks do not have
ownership in the company, instead, at-times tracking stock shareholders vote on issues affecting the corporate
parent, not the subsidiary whose stocks they own. Another downside is the fact that the board of directors of the
tracking-stock subsidiary is often put in place by the parent company and is not elected by tracking stock
shareholders, which would cause conflicts of interests.
The tracking stocks are highly skeptical also. Shareholders have limited voting rights, if any, and they cannot
elect their own boards. Moreover, if the parent company falls on hard times, conflict could develop between the
shareholders of a tracked division, especially if it continues to do well, and the shareholders of the parent
company. The potential for such conflict could affect the performance of the tracking stock.
Another important drawback with tracking stock is that it can dramatically increase the potential for conflict and
litigation over accounting policy. It is because the owners of the tracking stock have rights only over dividends,
and dividend payouts are driven by the recognition of divisional profits, the arguments over profit recognition are
almost sure to arise whenever tracking stock investors are disappointed in their returns. They will surely be
tempted to accuse corporate management of adopting policies that deliberately understate their profits.
# MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES
These securities assure a fixed return which is derived from the performance of the specific assets. They are
issued with a maturity period of 3 to 10 years and backed by pooled assets like mortgages, credit card receivables,
etc. There is a commitment from the loan originator and/or intermediary institution to ensure a minimum yield on maturity.
# FEATURES OF ASSETS TO BE SECURITISED
The assets to be securitized shall have the following features:
```
(a) The cash flows generated from the assets should be received periodically in accordance with a pre¬determined schedule.
```
```
(b) The actual cash flows generated from the assets should be predictable.
```
```
(c) The assets should be large in number and total value to be issued in securitized form.
```
```
(d) The assets should be sufficiently similar in nature to enable pooling of their cash flows. (e) The assets should be marketable.
```
Advantages of Asset backed Securities to Issuer
```
(a) The issuer can generate cash from the assets immediately enabling funds to be redeployed in other projects.
```

## Page 60

36 EP-CM&SL
```
(b) The issuer may be able to improve balance sheet ratios by excluding the original assets and the securities
```
created by the assets from the balance sheet by suitable structuring of the transaction.
Advantages of Asset backed Securities to Investor
These instruments have a relatively low credit risk since the securities are backed by good quality collateral and
offer a higher yield than Government securities.
# FUTURES
Futures is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a underlying asset of standardized quantity and quality
for a price agreed upon today with delivery and payment occurring at a specified future date. Underlying assets
for the purpose include equities, foreign exchange, interest bearing securities and commodities. The idea behind
financial futures contract is to transfer future changes in security prices from one party in the contract to the
other. It offers a means to manage risk in participating financial market. Futures basically transfer value rather
than create it. It is a means for reducing risk or assuming risk in the hope of profit. Every futures contract entered
into has two side willing buyer and a willing seller. If one side of contract makes a profit, the other side must
make a loss. All futures market participants taken together can neither lose nor gain the futures market is a zero sum game.
# OPTIONS
An option contract conveys the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific security or commodity at
specified price within a specified period of time. The right to buy is referred to as a call option whereas the right
to sell is known as a put option. An option contract comprises of its type a put or call, underlying security or
commodity expiry date, strike price at which it may be exercised.
Option provides the investor with the opportunity to hedge investments in the underlying shares and share
portfolios and can thus reduce the overall risk related to the investments significantly. Generally two type of options namely :
- European option – an option that may only be exercised on expiration.
- American option – an option that may be exercised on any trading day on or before expiry. Term one should know
- Long Position– A position showing a purchase or a greater number of purchase than sales in anticipation
of a rise in prices. A long position can be closed out through the sale of an equivalent amount.
- Short Position – In futures, the short has sold the commodity or security for future delivery; in options,
the short has sold the call or put and is obligated to take a futures position if he or she is assigned for exercise.
# HEDGE FUNDS
Hedge funds, including fund of funds are unregistered private investment partnerships, funds or pools that may
invest and trade in many different markets, strategies and instruments (including securities, non-securities and
derivatives) and are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, including mutual fund
requirements to provide certain periodic and standardized pricing and valuation information to investors.
The term can also be defined by considering the characteristics most commonly associated with hedge funds. Usually, hedge funds:
– are organized as private investment partnerships or offshore investment corporations;
– use a wide variety of trading strategies involving position-taking in a range of markets;

## Page 61

Lesson 2 Capital Market Instrumentss 37
– employ as assortment of trading techniques and instruments, often including short-selling, derivatives and leverage;
– pay performance fees to their managers; and
– have an investor base comprising wealthy individuals and institutions and relatively high minimum investment limit
Hedge Fund and Other Pooled Investment Vehicles
Hedge funds are sometimes called as ‘rich man’s mutual fund’. In addition, other unregistered investment pools,
such as venture capital funds, private equity funds and commodity pools, are sometimes referred to as hedge
funds. Although all of these investment vehicles are similar in that they accept investors’ money and generally
invest it on a collective basis, they also have characteristics that distinguish them from hedge funds.
Mutual Fund or Registered Investment Companies
In many ways, hedge funds are similar to mutual funds. Both entities issue units or securities to investors, hold
pools of securities to diversify investment, have professional asset manager and may, at times, have similar
investment strategies. At the same time, they also differ in a number of ways. Mutual funds are registered with
securities markets regulator and are subject to the provisions of the relevant regulations such as, offer/issue of
units/securities, disclosure and reporting requirement, valuation for the purpose of computation of NAV, conflict
of interest issue and limit leverage. Hedge funds are not required to be registered and therefore, are not subject to similar regulatory provisions.
### Private Equity Fund
A private equity fund, like a hedge fund, is an unregistered investment vehicle in which investors pool money to
invest. Private equity funds concentrate their investments in unregistered (and typically illiquid) securities. Like
hedge funds, private equity funds also rely on the exemption from registration of the offer and sale of their
securities. The investors in private equity funds and hedge funds typically include high net worth individuals and
families, pension funds, endowments, banks and insurance companies. Private equity funds, however, differ
from hedge funds in terms of the manner in which contribution to the investment pool is made by the investors.
Private equity investors typically commit to invest a certain amount of money with the fund over the life of the
fund, and make their contributions in response to “capital calls” from the fund’s general partner. Private equity
funds are long term investments, provide for liquidation at the end of the term specified in the fund’s governing
documents and offer little, if any, opportunities for investors to redeem their investments. A private equity fund
may distribute cash to its investors when it sells its portfolio investment, or it may distribute the securities of a portfolio company.
### Venture Capital Fund
Venture capital pools are similar to hedge funds or private equity; they attract the same class of investors.
Venture capital funds, however, invest in the start-up or early stages of a company. Unlike hedge fund advisors,
general partners of venture capital funds often play an active role in the companies in which the funds invest. In
contrast to a hedge fund, which may hold an investment in a portfolio security for an indefinite period based on
market events and conditions, a venture capital fund typically seeks to liquidate its investment once the value of
the company increases above the value of the investments.
### Commodity Pool
Commodity pools are investment rusts, syndicates or similar enterprises that are operated for the purpose of
trading commodity futures. The investment concentration in commodity futures distinguishes commodity pools from hedge funds.

## Page 62

38 EP-CM&SL
# DOMESTIC AND OFFSHORE HEDGE FUND
### Domestic Hedge Fund
Domestic hedge funds are usually organized (in USA) as limited partnerships to accommodate investors that
are subject to U.S. income taxation. The fund’s sponsor typically is the general partner and investment adviser.
Hedge funds may also take the form of limited liability companies (LLC) or business trusts. LLPs, LLCs and
business trusts are generally not separately taxed and, as a result, income is taxed only at the level of the
individual investors. Each of three firms also limits investors liability; LLCs offer the additional benefit of limited
liability for fund advisors (general partners).
### Offshore Hedge Fund
Offshore hedge funds are typically organized as corporations in countries such as the Cayman Islands, British
Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, Panama, The Netherlands Antilles or Bermuda. Offshore funds generally attract
investments of U.S. tax exempt entities, such as pension funds, charitable trusts, foundations and endowments,
as well as non-U.S. residents. U.S. tax-exempt investors favour investments in offshore hedge funds because
they may be subject to taxation if they invest in domestic limited partnership hedge funds. Market Benefits of Hedge Funds A Taxonomy of Hedge Fund Strategies
### Strategy Description
Directional Trading Based upon speculation of market direction in multiple asset classes. Both
model-based systems and subjective judgment are used to make trading decisions.
Relative Value Focus on spread relationships between pricing components of financial assets.
Market risk is kept to minimum and many managers use leverage to enhance returns.
Specialist Credit Based around lending to credit sensitive issuers. Funds in this strategy conduct
a high level of due diligence in order to identify relatively inexpensive securities.
Stock Selection Combine long and short positions, primarily in equities, in order to exploit
under and overvalued securities. Market exposure can vary substantially.
Hedge funds can provide benefits to financial markets by contributing to market efficiency and enhance liquidity.
Many hedge fund advisors take speculative trading positions on behalf of their managed hedge funds based
extensive research about the true value or future value of a security. They may also use short term trading
strategies to exploit perceived mis-pricings of securities. Because securities markets are dynamic, the result of
such trading is that market prices of securities will move toward their true value. Trading on behalf of hedge
funds can thus bring price information to the securities markets, which can translate into market price efficiency.
Hedge funds also provide liquidity to the capital markets by participating in the market.
Hedge funds play an important role in a financial system where various risks are distributed across a variety of
innovative financial instruments. They often assume risks by serving as ready counter parties to entities that
wish to hedge risks. For example, hedge funds are buyers and sellers of certain derivatives, such as securitised
financial instruments, that provide a mechanism for banks and other creditors to un-bundle the risks involved in
real economic activity. By actively participating in the secondary market for these instruments, hedge funds can
help such entities to reduce or manage their own risks because a portion of the financial risks are shifted to
investors in the form of these tradable financial instruments. By reallocating financial risks, this market activity
provides the added benefit of lowering the financing costs shouldered by other sectors of the economy. The
absence of hedge funds from these markets could lead to fewer risk management choices and a higher cost of

capital. Hedge fund can also serve as an important risk management tool for investors by providing valuable
portfolio diversification. Hedge fund strategies are typically designed to protect investment principal. Hedge
funds frequently use investment instruments (e.g. derivatives) and techniques (e.g. short selling) to hedge
against market risk and construct a conservative investment portfolio – one designed to preserve wealth.
In addition, hedge funds investment performance can exhibit low correlation to that of traditional investments in
the equity and fixed income markets. Institutional investors have used hedge funds to diversify their investments
based on this historic low correlation with overall market activity.
# EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS
Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a new variety of mutual fund that was first introduced 1993. ETFs are
sometimes described as more “tax efficient” than traditional equity mutual funds, since in recent years, some
large ETFs have made smaller distributions of realized and taxable capital gains than most mutual funds.
In short, they are similar to index mutual funds but are traded more like a stock. As their name implies,Exchange
Traded Funds represent a basket of securities that are traded on an exchange. Gold ETFs are most popular
among other ETFs, physical gold is kept as underlying security. As with all investment products, exchange
traded funds have their share of advantages and disadvantages.

meaning an ETF could potentially trade above or

Fund of funds (FoFs) is a mutual fund scheme, which invests in the schemes of same mutual funds or other
mutual funds, instead of investing in securities. These funds can invest in equity oriented, debt oriented and
liquid schemes or sector specific schemes. Depending on the investment style of the fund managers, fund of
funds schemes can be broadly classified into:
Sector specific funds: Such type of funds invest in different sectors of the economy and thus hedge themselves
against the under performance of any sector by taking the advantage from the rise in another sector.
Asset allocation funds: These funds diversify investment by holding several different asset classes at the same
time. By varying the stocks to bonds proportion, the fund endeavors to endow the investors, with an appropriate
asset allocation in different stages of their lives. They are also known as life cycle funds.

# BENEFITS OF FUND OF FUNDS SCHEME
### Diversification
As a fund of funds invests in the schemes of other funds, it provides a greater degree of diversification.
### Uncomplicated
Instead of investing in different stocks/units of mutual funds and keeping a track record of all of them, it will be
much easier to invest in and track only one fund, which in turn invests in other mutual funds.
### Cheap
While entering into the capital markets it is difficult to diversify because of limited funds. Fund of funds provide an
opportunity to go for diversification with comparatively limited amounts.
### Risk
Investors can trim down the risk by choosing this route. Because of diversification, even if one stock/scheme is
not performing well risk level comes down. Expertise of Various Managers
As in the case of schemes of mutual funds, fund of funds scheme also work under the due diligence of a fund
manager. This gives the scheme additional expertise as compared to other mutual funds schemes. These
schemes also provide access to information which may be difficult to obtain for an investor on a case by case basis.
# DISADVANTAGES OF FUND OF FUNDS SCHEME
However, just like any other investment, fund of funds is not free from shortcomings. Few of the disadvantages are specified below.
### Additional Fees
The more diversified the fund is, the greater the likelihood that the investor will incur an incentive fee on one or
more of the constituent managers, regardless of overall FoF performance.

## Page 65

Lesson 2 Capital Market Instrumentss 41
### Associated Risks
Risks associated with all the underlying funds get added at this level. Following are the type of risks associated with fund of funds scheme.
### Management Risks
Every fund manager has a particular style of diversification. This diversification style will be in perfect correlation
with the number of managers involved. The views of a manager may be altogether different from the market.
### Operational Risks
Due diligence of a scheme in itself gives rise to operational risks. Continuous monitoring is required for knowing
about performance of the funds, any possibility of a fraud and to know about the investment style of the funds
and any desirable or undesirable changes in it.
### Qualitative Risks
These include risks associated with the management environment of the fund such as organizational structure,
infrastructure, investment process, operational issues etc. Regulations in India
The fund of funds scheme was introduced in the Indian market by making suitable amendments in SEBI (Mutual Funds) (Amendment) Regulations, 2003.

# INTRODUCTION
Credit rating, in general sense, is the evaluation of the credit worthiness of an individual or of a business
concern or of an instrument of a business based on relevant factors indicating ability and willingness to pay obligations as well as net worth.
‘Encyclopedia of Banking & Finance’ by Charles J. Woelfel states that a credit rating is a letter or number used
by a mercantile or other agency in reports and credit rating books to denote the ability and disposition of various
businesses (individual, proprietorship, partnership or corporation) to meet their financial obligations. It also
states that ratings are used as a guide to the investment quality of bonds and stocks, based on security of
principal and interest (or dividends), earning power, mortgage position, market history and marketability.
Credit ratings establish a link between risk and return. An investor or any other interested person uses the
rating to assess the risk-level and compares the offered rate of return with his expected rate of return.
# EVOLUTION OF CREDIT RATING
The first Mercantile Credit Agency was established in New York in 1841. Its first rating guide was published in
1859 by Robert Dun. Another similar agency was set up by John Bradstreet which published its rating guide in
## 1857. These two agencies were merged to form Dun and Bradstreet in 1933 which acquired Moody’s Investor
Service in 1962. Moody’s was founded by Moody in 1900. The other world renowned rating agency namely
Standard and Poor was created in 1941 by merging the Standard Statistics Company and Poor’s Publishing Company which had their origin earlier.
In India CRISIL (Credit Rating and Information Services (India) Limited) was set up as the first credit rating
agency in 1987. This was followed by ICRA Limited (Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India
Limited) in 1991 and CARE (Credit Analyses and Research Limited) in 1994 and then in 1999 Fitch Rating India
Pvt. Ltd. now known as India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd., Brickwork Rating Pvt. Ltd. in 2008, SMERA (SME
Rating Agency of India Limited) in 2011 and Info Merics Valuation and Ratings Pvt. Ltd. All these seven credit
rating agencies are registered with the SEBI. CONCEPT & OVERVIEW
Credit Rating is a symbolic indication of the current opinion regarding the relative capability of a corporate entity
to service its debt obligations in time with reference to the instrument being rated. It enables the investor to
differentiate between debt instruments on the basis of their underlying credit quality. To facilitate simple and
easy understanding, credit rating is expressed in alphabetical or alphanumerical symbols.
A rating is specific to a debt instrument and is intended to grade different such instruments in terms of credit risk
and ability of the company to service the debt obligations as per terms of contract namely - principal as well as
interest. A rating is neither a general purpose evaluation of a corporate entity, nor an over all assessment of the
credit risk likely to be involved in all the debts contracted or to be contracted by such entity.
Though credit rating is considered more relevant for gradation of debt securities, it can be applied for other
purposes also. The diagram below depicts various types of credit ratings:

# PURPOSES
The various instruments which can be rated may be –
– Credit rating does not bound the investor to decide whether to hold or sell an instrument as it does
not take into consideration factors such as market prices, personal risk preferences and other
consideration which may influence an investment decision. It does not create any fiduciary
relationship between the rating agency and the user of the rating. A credit rating agency does not
perform an audit but relies on information provided by the issuer and collected by the analysts from
different sources hence it does not guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the information on which the rating is based.
– Long-term/Medium-term debt obligations such as debentures, bonds, preference shares or project finance
debts are considered long-term and debts ranging from 1 to 3 years like fixed deposits are considered medium-term;
– Short-term debt obligations - the period involved is one year or less and cover money market instruments
such as commercial paper, credit notes, cash certificates etc.;
– Equity Grading and Assessment, structured obligations, municipal bonds, mutual fund schemes, plantation
schemes, real estate projects, infrastructure related debts, ADR, GDR issues, bank securities etc.
In determining a rating, both qualitative and quantitative analyses are employed. The judgment is qualitative
in nature and the role of the quantitative analysis is to help make the best possible overall qualitative
judgment or opinion. The reliability of the rating depends on the validity of the criteria and the quality of analysis.
The quality of credit rating mainly depends upon the quality of the rating agency and rating elements also.
The agency should have good reputation, personal competence, independence, qualified and experienced staff.
# USES OF CREDIT RATING
Credit rating is extremely important as it not only plays a role in investor protection but also benefits industry
as a whole in terms of direct mobilization of savings from individuals. Rating also provide a marketing tool to
the company and its investment bankers in placing company’s debt obligations with a investor base that is
aware of, and comfortable with, the level of risk. Ratings also encourage discipline amongst corporate borrowers
to improve their financial structure and operating risks to obtain a better rating for their debt obligations and
thereby lower the cost of borrowing. Companies those get a lower rating are forewarned, as it were and have
the freedom, if they desire, to take steps on their financial or business risks and thereby improve their standing in the market.
Credit rating is useful to investors, issuers, intermediaries and regulators.
### For Investors
The main purpose of credit rating is to communicate to the investors the relative ranking of the default loss
probability for a given fixed income investment, in comparison with other rated instruments. In a way it is
essentially an information service. In the absence of professional credit rating, the investor has to largely
depend on his familiarity with the names of promoters or collaborators of a company issuing debt instruments.
This is not a reliable method. Credit rating by skilled, competent and credible professionals eliminates or at least
minimizes the role of name recognition and replaces it with a well researched and properly analyzed opinion.
This method provides a low cost supplement to investors. Large investors use information provided by rating
agencies such as upgrades and downgrades and alter their portfolio mix by operating in the secondary market.
Investors also use the industry reports, corporate reports, seminars and open access provided by the credit rating agencies.

### For Issuers
The market places immense faith in opinion of credit rating agencies, hence the issuers also depend on their
critical analysis. This enables the issuers of highly rated instruments to access the market even during adverse
market conditions. Credit rating provides a basis for determining the additional return (over and above a risk free
return) which investors must get in order to be compensated for the additional risk that they bear. The difference
in price leads to significant cost savings in the case of highly rated instruments.
### For Intermediaries
Rating is useful to Intermediaries such as merchant bankers for planning, pricing, underwriting and placement
of the issues. Intermediaries like brokers and dealers in securities use rating as an input for monitoring risk
exposures. Merchant bankers also use credit rating for pre-packaging issues by way of asset securitization/ structured obligations.
### For Regulators
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) prescribes a number of regulatory uses of ratings. The RBI requires that a
NBFC must have minimum investment grade credit rating if it intends to accept public deposits. As per money
market regulations of the RBI, a corporate must get an issue of CP rated and can issue such paper subject to a
minimum rating. SEBI has also stipulated that ratings are compulsory for all public issue of debentures. SEBI
has also made mandatory for acceptance of public deposit by Collective Investment Schemes.
# FACTORS FOR SUCCESS OF A RATING SYSTEM
– Credible and independent structure and procedures;
– Objectivity and impartiality of opinions;
– Analytical research, integrity and consistency;
– Professionalism and industry related expertise; – Confidentiality;
– Timeliness of rating review and announcement of changes;
Ability to reach wide range of investors by means of press reports, print or electronic media and investor oriented research services.
IMPORTANT ISSUES IN CREDIT RATING Investments and Speculative Grades
Debt instrument rated ‘BBB’ & above are classified as investment grade ratings. Instruments that are rated ‘BB’
and below are classified as speculative grade ratings. Rating agencies do not recommend or indicate the rating
levels of instruments up to which one should or should not invest.
### Surveillance
The rating published by credit rating agencies is subjected to a continuous surveillance during the life of the
instrument or so long as any amount is outstanding against the specific instrument. The frequency of surveillance
may range between quarterly or yearly. A formal and extensive written review is taken at least once in a year but
where some specific concern arises about the industry or the issuing entity, the review is taken up immediately.
Where the rating agency justified may change the rating by upgradation or downgradation depending on the
likely impact of changing circumstances on the debt servicing capability of the issuer. In other cases, the rating is retained at the same level.
### Credit Watch
When a major deviation from the expected trends of the issuers business occurs, or when an event has taken

## Page 73

Lesson 3 Credit Rating & IPO Grading 49
place, it creates an impact on the debt servicing capability of the issuer and warrants a rating change, the rating
agency may put such ratings under credit watch till the exact impact of such unanticipated development is
analyzed and decision is taken regarding the rating change. The credit watch listing may also specify positive or
negative outlooks. It should be noted that being under credit watch does not necessarily mean that there would be a rating change. Ownership as a rating consideration
Ownership by a strong concern may enhance the credit rating of an entity, unless there exists a strong barrier
separating the activities of the parent and the subsidiary. The important issues involved in deciding the
relationship are - the mutual dependence on each other, legal relationship, to what extent one entity has the
desire and ability to influence the business of the other, and how important is the operation of the subsidiary to the owner.
Rating agency keeps the information provided by the issuer confidential and completes the rating within 2 to 4
weeks. Once the rating is assigned, it is communicated to the issuer, who is given an opportunity to make one
request for a review, only in case fresh facts or clarifications become relevant. After these are considered, the
final rating is assigned. In India, the issuer has the option of not accepting the assigned rate in which case the
rating is not disclosed by the rating agency. However, if the rating is accepted, it comes under the surveillance process of the concerned agency.
# RATING METHODOLOGIES
# RATING OF MANUFACTURING COMPANIES
The factors generally considered for rating of manufacturing companies are as under:
### Industry Risk
It is defined as the strength of the industry within the economy and relativity to the economic trends. It is
evaluated on the basis of factors like business cyclicality, earnings volatility, growth prospects, demand - supply
projections, entry barriers and extent of competition and nature and extent of regulation. Company’s industry and market position
The company’s sales position in its major fields and its historical background of its market position is analyzed
along with ability to sustain/increase market shares; brand strengths and position; price leadership and distribution and marketing strengths/weaknesses. Operating efficiencies
Ability to control costs, productivity efficiencies relative to others, labour relationship, extent of forward and
backward integration, access to raw materials/markets, and technology.
### Accounting Quality
Financial statements are adjusted for non-standard accounting treatments. Overall evaluation of the accounting
policies employed and the extent to which they understate or overstate financial performance and position.
These include analysis of auditor’s qualifications, revenue recognition, depreciation policy, inventory evaluation,
funding for pension liabilities, undervalued assets etc. Financial flexibility
Evaluation of the company’s financing needs, plans and alternatives, its flexibility to accomplish its financing
programmes under stress without damaging creditworthiness. Earnings protection
The key measurements which indicate the basic long term earnings power of the company including return on

## Page 74

50 EP-CM&SL
capital, profit margins, earnings from various business segments, sources of future earnings growth, coverage ratios etc. Financial leverage
Relative usage of debt and levels of debt appropriate to different types of businesses, utilization of long and
short term sources of funds, management of working capital. Cash flow adequacy
It is the relationship of cash flows to leverage and the ability to internally meet all cash needs of the business. It
measures the magnitude and variability of future cash flows relative to debt servicing obligations and other
commitments such as group company funding, BIFR packages and contingent liabilities. This analysis goes into
the inherent protective factors for expected cash flows of the company and the sensitivity of these cash flows to
changes in variables like raw material costs and selling prices. Management evaluation
The record of achievement in operations and financial results, strategic and financial planning, commitment,
consistency and credibility, overall quality of management, line of succession, strength of middle management
and organization structure and its linkage with the operating environment and management strategies.
# RATING OF FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES
The rating methodology for non-banking financial services companies is based on CAMELS model encompassing,
Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, systems and control.
In 1995, RBI had set up a working group under the chairmanship of Shri S. Padmanabhan to review the banking
supervision system. The Committee made certain recommendations and based on such suggestions a rating
system for domestic and foreign banks based on the international CAMELS model combining financial
management and systems and control elements was introduced for the inspection cycle commencing from July
## 1998. It recommended that the banks should be rated on the lines of international CAMELS model. The following six parameters are recommended:
```
(i) Capital Adequacy : Capital adequacy is measured by the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (CRAR).
```
A sound capital base strengthens confidence of depositors.
```
(ii) Asset Quality: One of the indicators for asset quality is the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans
```
```
(GNPA). The gross non-performing loans to gross advances ratio is more indicative of the quality of
```
credit decisions made by bankers. Higher GNPA is indicative of poor credit decision-making.
```
(iii) Management : The ratio of non-interest expenditures to total assets (MGNT) can be one of the measures
```
to assess the working of the management. This variable, which includes a variety of expenses, such as
payroll, workers compensation and training investment, reflects the management policy stance.
```
(iv) Earnings: It can be measured as the return on asset ratio.
```
```
(v) Liquidity: Cash maintained by the banks and balances with central bank, to total asset ratio (LQD) is an
```
indicator of bank’s liquidity. In general, banks with a larger volume of liquid assets are perceived safe,
since these assets would allow banks to meet unexpected withdrawals.
```
(iv) Systems and Control: The internal controls, other systems and procedures of banks are considered.
```
RATING OF STRUCTURED OBLIGATIONS/ASSET SECURITISATION
Structured borrowing arrangements are entered into by companies for various reasons. However, the most
important one is that less credit worthy instruments or corporates are able to tap sources of funds at a more
advantageous borrowing rate by offering a variety of credit enhancements.

## Page 75

Lesson 3 Credit Rating & IPO Grading 51
The process of converting loans or receivables into negotiable instruments is known as securitization. These
negotiable instruments are sold to investors’; they are secured by the underlying assets and have other credit
enhancements. Securitization transforms illiquid assets like the renewable portfolio on the balance sheet of a lender into a marketable security.
The principal credit risk in asset backed financing is potential impairment of cash flows due to the assets becoming
defaulting on repayments or turning into a loss. The main factors considered for credit rating are the overall risk
profile and monitoring and collection procedures of the issuer; the quality of the assets being securitized; the
process of selection of the asset pool to be securitized; the characteristics of the pool and the cash flows from it
based on the past record of its behaviour. The possible credit loss and other deficiencies of the pool in terms of
timing and quantum of cash flows are analyzed and the extent and nature of credit enhancement is then determined.
Other important considerations in a securitization transaction are the legal and tax structure and the ability and
willingness of the services and trustee to manage and maintain control on assets and payment streams from them.
# RATING PROCESS
Rating process refers to the typical practices and procedures which a rating agency follows to gather information
for evaluating the credit risk of specific issuers and issues, to analyze and conclude on the appropriate rating to
monitor the credit quality of the rated issuer or security over time, deciding on timely changes in ratings, as and
when companies’ fundamentals change and to keep investors and the market players informed. All these are
interrelated and on going processes. The rating agencies in India have adopted the methodology of the major international credit rating agencies.
The rating process begins with the receipt of a mandate from the issuer company. The next step is to form analytical teams with sectoral skills. Information gathering/analysis
For the basic research, obtain credit related data, both statistical and qualitative, from a multitude of sources like
annual reports, prospectus, industry/sectoral economic data, government reports, news reports, discussions
with industry/ regulatory/other circles. Statistical data bases are developed over time to enable comparability across major issuer categories. Meetings with Management
Meetings are held with key operating personnel of the company covering broadly the background, history,
organisational structure, operating performance, financial management and topics of special relevance to the
company’s future. The central focus of all discussions is the same with analysts looking for information that will help
them to understand the issuer’s ability to generate cash from operations to meet debt obligations over the next
several years. It is the management’s opportunity to explain the company’s business and financial strategies.
Finally, a meeting with top management is held, where apart from corporate strategy and philosophy, key issues
relevant to the rating are discussed. A plant visit with the major manufacturing/work centres and project sites is invariably undertaken.
In India, credit rating agencies do not undertake unsolicited ratings merely based on published information of
the company. The quality of credit rating will greatly improve with privileged information obtained from the
companies by credit rating agencies. It is possible to have two agencies to do the rating for a particular issue and
the findings may even vary, because rating is a matter of perceptions. But generally the findings will not be varying widely.
The ratings can be published by the agency only after approval and with the permission of the issuer. Subsequent
changes emerging out of the monitoring by the credit rating agency will be published even if such changes are
not found acceptable to the issuers. The issuer may appeal on the findings of an agency. In such a case the

## Page 76

52 EP-CM&SL
agency will undertake a review and thereafter indicate its final decision. Unless the rating agency has over
looked critical information at the first stage, chances of the rating being changed on appeal will be rare.
There is no system yet to rate the rating agency. Informed public opinion is the touch stone on which the rating
companies are being assessed. The success of a rating agency is measured by the quality, consistency and
integrity and the record of acceptance in the market. The rating is always about a particular issue and not generally about the issuer.

# REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
SEBI (CREDIT RATING AGENCIES) REGULATIONS, 1999
SEBI regulations for Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) cover rating of securities only and not rating of fixed deposits,
foreign exchange, country ratings, real estates etc. CRAs can be promoted by public financial institutions,
scheduled commercial banks, foreign banks operating in India, foreign credit rating agencies recognised in the
country of their incorporation, having at least five years experience in rating, or any company or a body corporate
having continuous net worth of minimum`100 crore for the previous five years. CRAs would be required to have
a minimum net worth of` 5 crore. A CRA can not rate a security issued by its promoter. No Chairman, Director
or Employee of the promoters shall be Chairman, Director or Employee of CRA or its rating committee. A CRA
can not rate securities issued by any borrower, subsidiary, an associate promoter of CRA, if there are common
Chairman, Directors and Employees between the CRA or its rating committee and these entities. A CRA can not

## Page 77

Lesson 3 Credit Rating & IPO Grading 53
rate a security issued by its associate or subsidiary if the CRA or its rating committee has a Chairman, Director
or Employee who is also a Chairman, Director or Employee of any such entity. CRAs would have to carry out
periodic reviews of the ratings given during the lifetime of the rated instrument. For ensuring that corporates
provide correct/ adequate information to CRAs, a clause would be incorporated in the listing agreement of the
stock exchanges requiring the companies to co-operate with the rating agencies in giving correct and adequate
information. Issuers coming out with a public/rights issue of debt securities would be required to incorporate an
undertaking in the offer documents promising necessary co-operation with the rating agency in providing true and adequate information. Registration of Credit Rating Agencies

case such Indicative Ratings are provided by the CRA, it shall be considered as aiding and abetting the Issuer
in suppression of material information by the CRA which would be in contravention of Clause 12 of Code of
Conduct of CRAs and may result in violation of the provisions of section 12A of the Securities and Exchange
Board of India Act, 1992 and SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 by the CRA. Monitoring of Ratings
Credit rating agency should during the lifetime of securities rated by it continuously monitor the rating of such
securities. It should also disseminate information regarding newly assigned ratings, and changes in earlier
rating promptly through press releases and websites, and, in the case of securities issued by listed companies,
such information should also be provided simultaneously to the concerned to all the stock exchanges where the said securities are listed. Procedure for Review of Rating
Every credit rating agency should carry out periodic review of all published ratings during the lifetime of the
securities. If the client does not co-operate with the credit rating agency so as to enable the credit rating agency
to comply with its obligations, the credit rating agency should carry out the review on the basis of the best available information.
However, it has been provided that if owing to such lack of co-operation, a rating has been based on the best
available information, the credit rating agency should disclose to the investors the fact that the rating is so
based. A credit rating agency should not withdraw a rating so long as the obligations under the security rated by
it are outstanding, except where the company whose security is rated is wound up or merged or amalgamated with another company.

TRANSPARENCY & DISCLOSURE NORMS FOR CREDIT RATINGAGENCIES
Recent events in global financial system have underlined the pivotal role that credit ratings play. Effective use of
credit ratings by the users is crucially dependent upon quality and quantity of disclosures made by the Credit
Rating Agencies (CRAs). There have been widespread consultations on the issue both globally and within India

## Page 86

62 EP-CM&SL
and several documents have been prepared. In the wake of the above and in order to impart higher credibility to
the processes and procedures associated with the credit rating, SEBI in consultation with the CRAs, prescribed
the following transparency and disclosure norms for the CRAs.
### Rating Process
A CRA shall keep the following records in support of each credit rating and review / surveillance thereof:
- The important factors underlying the credit rating and sensitivity of such credit rating to changes in these factors;
- Summary of discussions with the issuer, its management, auditors and bankers which have a bearing on the credit rating;
- Decisions of the rating committee(s), including voting details and notes of dissent, if any, by any member of the rating committee, and
- If a quantitative model is a substantial component of the credit rating process, the rationale for
any material difference between the credit rating implied by the model and the credit rating actually assigned.
Any change in the rating process or policies shall be disclosed in the CRA’s website, to enable the investors to discern the changes made to the same.
These records should be maintained till five years after maturity of instruments and be made available to auditors
and regulatory bodies when sought by them.
### Default Studies
The CRA, should publish information about the historical default rates of CRA rating categories and whether the
default rates of these categories have changed over time, so that the public can understand the historical
performance of each category and if and how rating categories have changed, and be able to draw quality
comparisons among ratings given by different CRAs. The default rates shall be calculated in the following manner:
- One Year Default Rate is the weighted average of default rates of all possible 1 year static pools in the 5-year period.
- Cumulative Default Rate: The cumulative default rate (CDR) represents the likelihood of an entity that
was rated at the beginning of any multi-year period defaulting at any time during the multi-year period.
Three-year cumulative default rate shall be computed as: Three-year CDR for rating category X = No. of
issuers which defaulted over the three-year period / No. of issuers outstanding at the beginning of the three-year period. Here,
Static Pool: Non-defaulted ratings that were outstanding at the beginning of any period.
```
Default: Non-payment of interest or principal amount in full on the pre-agreed date. A
```
CRA shall recognize default at the first instance of delay in servicing of interest
or principal on the rated debt instrument.
Default Rate: The number of defaults among rated entities in the static pool as a percentage
of the total number of entities in the static pool.
```
Averaging: All averaging across static pools for default rate computations must be based
```
on the weighted average method where the weights are the number of ratings in each static period.

# IPO GRADING
IPO grading (Initial Public Offering Grading) is a service aimed at facilitating the assessment of equity issues
offered to public. The grade assigned to any individual issue represents a relative assessment of the ‘fundamentals’
of that issue in relation to the universe of other listed equity securities in India. Such grading is assigned on a
five-point scale with a higher score indicating stronger fundamentals. IPO Grade 1 – Poor Fundamentals
IPO Grade 2 – Below - Average Fundamentals IPO Grade 3 – Average Fundamentals
IPO Grade 4 – Above-average fundamentals IPO Grade 5 – Strong fundamentals
IPO grading is different from an investment recommendation. Investment recommendations are expressed as
‘buy’, ‘hold’ or ‘sell’ and are based on a security specific comparison of its assessed ‘fundamentals factors’
```
(business prospects, financial position etc.) and ‘market factors’ (liquidity, demand supply etc.) to its price. On
```
the other hand, IPO grading is expressed on a five-point scale and is a relative comparison of the assessed
fundamentals of the graded issue to other listed equity securities in India.
As the IPO grading does not take cognizance of the price of the security, it is not an investment recommendation.
Rather, it is one of the inputs to the investor to aiding in the decision making process.
As per SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, every unlisted company obtaining grading for IPO shall disclose all the grades
obtained, along with the rationale discretion furnished by the credit rating agency(ies) for each of the grades
obtained, in the prospectus, abridged prospectus, issue advertisements and at all other places where the issuer company is advertising for the IPO.
SEBI has been taking a pioneering role in investor protection by increasing disclosure levels by entities seeking
to access equity markets for funding. This has caused India to be amongst one of the more transparent and
efficient capital markets in the world. However, these disclosures demand fairly high levels of analytical
sophistication of the reader in order to effectively achieve the goal of information dissemination.
IPO grading is positioned as a service that provides ‘an independent assessment of fundamentals’ to aid
comparative assessment that would prove useful as an information and investment tool for investors. Moreover,
such a service would be particularly useful for assessing the offerings of companies accessing the equity markets
for the first time where there is no track record of their market performance.
As mentioned above, the IPO grade assigned to any issue represents a relative assessment of the ‘fundamentals’
of that issue in relation to the universe of other listed equity securities in India. This grading can be used by the
investor as tool to make investment decision. The IPO grading will help the investor better appreciate the meaning
of the disclosures in the issue documents to the extent that they affect the issue’s fundamentals. Thus, IPO
grading is an additional investor information and investment guidance tool.

Lesson 3 Credit Rating & IPO Grading 69 Procedure forIPO Grading
Credit Rating agencies (CRAs) registered with SEBI will carry out IPO grading.
SEBI does not play any role in the assessment made by the grading agency. The grading is intended to be an
independent and unbiased opinion of that agency.
It is intended that IPO fundamentals would be graded on a five point scale from grade 5 (indicating strong
fundamentals) to grade 1 (indicating poor fundamentals). The grade would read as: "Rating Agency name" IPO
Grade 1 viz. CARE IPO Grade 1, CRISIL IPO Grade 1 etc.
The assigned grade would be a one time assessment done at the time of the IPO and meant to aid investors
who are interested in investing in the IPO. The grade will not have any ongoing validity.
The company needs to first contact one of the grading agencies and mandate it for the grading exercise. The
agency would then follow the process outlined below.
– Seek information required for the grading from the company.
– On receipt of required information, have discussions with the company’s management and visit the
company’s operating locations, if required.
– Prepare an analytical assessment report.
– Present the analysis to a committee comprising senior executives of the concerned grading agency.
This committee would discuss all relevant issues and assign a grade.
– Communicate the grade to the company along with an assessment report outlining the rationale for the grade assigned.
Though this process will ideally require 2-3 weeks for completion, it may be a good idea for companies to initiate
the grading process about 6-8 weeks before the targeted IPO date to provide sufficient time for any contingencies. Points to Remember
IPO grading is optional as per SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 w.e.f. February 04, 2014

# INTRODUCTION
There are 19 stock exchanges at present in India. All of them are regulated in terms of Securities Contract
```
(Regulation) Act, 1956 and SEBI Act, 1992 and the rules and regulations made thereunder. Some of the exchanges
```
started of as voluntary non-profit associations such as Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and Indore Stock Exchange.
The Stock Exchanges at Chennai, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Pune were incorporated as companies limited by
guarantee. The other stock exchanges are companies limited by shares and incorporated under the Companies
Act, 1956 (now Companies Act, 2013) or earlier acts.
Pursuant to Section 131 of the Finance Act, 2015 and Central Government Notification F. No. 1/9/SM/2015
dated 28th August, 2015 all recognized association (commodity derivatives exchanges) under the Forwards
Contracts Act, 1952 and deemed to recognized stock exchange under the SCRA, 1956.
The stock exchanges are managed by Board of Directors or Council of Management consisting of elected
brokers and representatives of Government and Public appointed by SEBI. The Boards of stock exchanges are
empowered to make and enforce rules, bye-laws and regulations with jurisdiction over all its members.
The Acts, Rules and Regulations governing the stock exchanges have been separately discussed in a lesson in of this study material.
Membership of stock exchanges is generally given to persons financially sound and with adequate experience/
training in stock market. Their enrolment as member is regulated and controlled by SEBI to whom they have to
pay an annual charge. A member of the stock exchange is called ‘broker’ who can transact on behalf of his
clients as well as on his own behalf. A non-member can deal in securities only through members. A broker can
also take the assistance of sub-broker whom he can appoint under the procedure of registration.
# STOCK EXCHANGE TRADING MECHANISM
The stock exchange is a key institution facilitating the issue and sale of various types of securities. It is a pivot
around which every activity of the capital market revolves. In the absence of the stock exchange, the people with
savings would hardly invest in corporate securities for which there would be no liquidity (buying and selling
facility). Corporate investments from the general public would have been thus lower.
Stock exchanges thus represent the market place for buying and selling of securities and ensuring liquidity to
them in the interest of the investors. The stock exchanges are virtually the nerve centre of the capital market and
reflect the health of the country’s economy as a whole.
Securities are traded in three different ways in stock exchanges ring, namely–settlement basis, spot basis and cash basis.
Shares of companies which are not in the spot list are known as ‘cash’ shares or ‘B’ Category shares. They are
traded on cash basis or delivery basis and cannot be traded on settlement basis. The actual delivery of securities
and payment has to be made on or before the settlement date fixed in the case of cash basis trading.
As far as spot trading is concerned the actual delivery of securities must be made to the buying broker within 48
hours of the contract. It is expected that the seller would be paid by the buyer immediately on delivery of securities.
All securities whether the specified list or cash list can be traded on spot basis or cash basis.

## Page 99

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 75 Types of Securities Types of Securities
Listed cleared Securities Permitted Securities
The securities of companies, which have signed the To facilitate the market participants to trade in securities
listing agreement with a stock exchange, are traded as of such companies, which are actively traded at other
“Listed Securities” in that exchange. The securities stock exchanges in India but are not listed on an
admitted for dealing on stock exchange after complying exchange, trading in such securities is facilitated as
with all the listing requirements and displayed by board “permitted securities” provided they meet the relevant
on the list of cleared securities. norms specified by the stock exchange. Types of Delivery
Types of delivery in the stock exchanges are spot delivery, hand delivery and special delivery.
Spot Delivery Where the delivery of and payment for securities are to be made on the same
day as the day of contract or on the next day.
Hand Delivery Where the delivery of and payment are to be made on the delivery date fixed by the stock exchange authorities.
Special Delivery Where delivery and payment made after the delivery date fixed by the stock exchange authorities.
Just as we are faced with day to day uncertainties pertaining to weather, health, traffic etc and take steps to
minimize the uncertainties, so also in the stock markets, there is uncertainty in the movement of share prices.
This uncertainty leading to risk is sought to be addressed by margining systems by stock markets.
Suppose an investor, purchases 1000 shares of ‘xyz’ company at Rs.100/- on January 1, 2017. Investor has to
give the purchase amount of Rs.1,00,000/- (1000 x 100) to his broker on or before January 2, 2017. Broker, in
turn, has to give this money to stock exchange on January 3, 2017.
There is always a small chance that the investor may not be able to bring the required money by required date.
As an advance for buying the shares, investor is required to pay a portion of the total amount of Rs.1,00,000/- to
the broker at the time of placing the buy order. Stock exchange in turn collects similar amount from the broker
upon execution of the order. This initial token payment is called margin.
Remember, for every buyer there is a seller and if the buyer does not bring the money, seller may not get his /
her money. Margin is levied on the seller also to ensure that he / she gives the 100 shares sold to the broker who in turn gives it to the stock exchange.
Margin payments ensure that each investor is serious about buying or selling shares.
In the above example, assume that margin was 15%. That is investor has to give Rs.15,000/- (15% of Rs.1,00,000)
to the broker before buying. Now suppose that investor bought the shares at 11 am on January 1, 2017. Assume
that by the end of the day price of the share falls by Rs.25/-. That is total value of the shares has come down to
| Spot Delivery | Where the delivery of and payment for securities are to be made on the same
day as the day of contract or on the next day. |
| --- | --- |
| Hand Delivery | Where the delivery of and payment are to be made on the delivery date fixed
by the stock exchange authorities. |
| Special Delivery | Where delivery and payment made after the delivery date fixed by the stock

Rs.75,000/-. That is buyer has suffered a notional loss of Rs.25,000/-. In our example buyer has paid Rs.15,000/-
as margin but the notional loss, because of fall in price, is Rs.25,000/-. That is notional loss is more than the margin given.
In such a situation, the buyer may not want to pay Rs.1,00,000/- for the shares whose value has come down to Rs.75,000/-.
Similarly, if the price has gone up by Rs.25/-, the seller may not want to give the shares at Rs.1,00,000/-. To
ensure that both buyers and sellers fulfil their obligations irrespective of prices movements, notional losses are
also need to be collected. Prices of shares may keep on moving every day. Margins ensure that buyers bring
money and sellers bring shares to complete their obligations even though the prices have moved down or up.
### Margins
An advance payment of a portion of the value of a stock transaction. The amount of credit a broker or lender
extends to a customer for stock purchase.
### Margin Trading
Margin trading was introduced by SEBI to curb speculative dealings in shares leading to volatility in the prices of securities.
“Initial margin” in this context means the minimum amount, calculated as a percentage of the transaction
value, to be placed by the client, with the broker, before the actual purchase. The broker may advance the
balance amount to meet full settlement obligations.
“Maintenance margin” means the minimum amount, calculated as a percentage of market value of the securities,
calculated with respect to last trading day’s closing price, to be maintained by client with the broker.
When the balance deposit in the client’s margin account falls below the required maintenance margin, the
broker shall promptly make margin calls. However, no further exposure can be granted to the client on the basis
of any increase in the market value of the securities.
The broker may liquidate the securities if the client fails to meet the margin calls made by the broker or fails to
deposit the cheques on the day following the day on which the margin call has been made or the cheque has been dishonoured.
The broker may also liquidate the securities in case the client’s deposit in the margin account (after adjustment
for mark to market losses) falls to 30% or less of the latest market value of the securities, in the interregnum
between making of the margin call and receipt of payment from the client.
The broker must disclose to the stock exchange details on gross exposure including the name of the client,
unique identification number, name of the scrip and if the broker has borrowed funds for the purpose of providing
margin trading facilities, name of the lender and amount borrowed, on or before 12 Noon on the following day.
Stock exchanges disclose scripwise gross outstanding in margin accounts with all brokers to the market. Such
disclosures regarding margin trading done on any day shall be made available after the trading hours on the following day through the website. Characterstics of Margin
– Margin trading acts as a check on the tendency of clients to manipulate markets by placing orders on
brokers without having adequate money or securities to backup the transaction.
– Margin trading will also acts as a curb on short selling and short buying.
– Margin trading mechanism also ensures transparency in dealings in securities and public exposure of the
information regarding the backing behind all major securities transactions.
– In the Indian capital markets particularly excessive short selling and market positioning have been rampant.
Margin trading has acted as a stabilising force.

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 77 Book Closure and Record Date
Book closure is the periodic closure of the Register of Members and Transfer Books of the company, to take a
record of the shareholders to determine their entitlement to dividends or to bonus or right shares or any other
rights pertaining to shares. Record date is the date on which the records of a company are closed for the
purpose of determining the stock holders to whom dividends, proxies rights etc. are to be sent.
In accordance with Section 91 of the Companies Act, 2013 a company may close the register of members for a
maximum of 45 days in a year and for not more than 30 days at any one time. Book closure is necessary for the
purpose of paying dividend, making rights issue or bonus issue. The listed company is required to give notice of
book closure in a news paper at least 7 days before the commencement of the book closure. The members
whose names appear in the register of members on the last date of book closure are entitled to receive the
benefits of dividend, right shares or bonus shares as the case may be.
Trading of Partly Paid Shares and Debentures
Companies fix the last date for payment of allotment or call money in case of partly paid shares or debentures
and intimate this to all the stock exchanges wherein such shares or debentures are listed. Based on the date
fixed by the company, the stock exchanges determine the settlement date upto which transactions in the scrip
will be deemed to be good for delivery. After the said date, transactions in the securities take place only if they
are paid up to the extent money has been called up.
### Trend Line
When the price of shares moves in a particular direction which persists for a period of time, a price line is
regarded as established. When the movement is upward, the trend is called ‘BULLISH’ and when the movement
is downward it is called ‘BEARISH’. Bear market is a weak or falling market characterised by the dominance of
sellers. Whereas Bull market is a rising market with abundance of buyers and relatively few sellers.
Secondary movements that reverse the uptrend temporarily are known as reactions. The movements that reverse
the down trend temporarily are known as rallies. When an uptrend breaks in the downward direction, it is called trend reversal.
### Trading Volume
Trading volumes confirm whether the rise or fall in prices is in line with the trend. The high trading volume is built
on rising prices, similarly the high trading volume is also linked with fall in prices. They respectively reflect a BULLISH trend and a BEARISH trend. Turnover and Outstanding Position
The net turnover and outstanding positions in various scrips show the extent of BULLISH interest in them and
are used along with trading volume to judge the intensity of the phase whether BULLISH or BEARISH. In a BULL
phase there will be a sharp rise in the daily turnover of key scrips and in a BEAR phase the reverse will be the case.
# MARKET MAKING
Market making is a process where the market makers offers a two way quote (both buy and sell) to increase the
supply and demand of the scrip. This increase the liquidity in the stock.
Market-making is aimed at infusing liquidity in securities that are not frequently traded on stock exchanges. A
market-maker is responsible for enhancing the demand supply situation in securities such as stocks and futures
& options (F&O ). To understand this concept better, it would be helpful to have an idea about the existing screen
based electronic trading system. In this system , orders placed by buyers and sellers are matched by a computer

## Page 102

78 EP-CM&SL
system (run by stock exchanges). This system is beneficial for actively-traded stocks, but not for lesser-traded
ones. Investors usually ignore thinly-traded stocks despite good fundamentals due to fears that they might not
be able to trade more frequently in them. The introduction of the market-making facility could be a possible
means to infuse liquidity into such shares. In overseas markets, a market-maker is usually a broker or an
institution. As a result, there is an incentive for the broker to recommend securities for which he creates a market.
A market-maker usually is responsible for enhancing activity in a few chosen securities. In the process, the
market-maker provides both a buy and a sell quote for his chosen securities. He profits from the spread between
buy and sell quotes. For example, if the market-maker gives a bid-ask quote of ` 505-500 (which means the
market-maker will buy from the market at` 500 and sell at` 505), then the profit is` 5. For illiquid securities, the
profit spreads are usually higher (within a regulator-prescribed band) because of the higher risk taken by the market-maker.
Market-makers are obligated to buy or sell the security at a price and size they have quoted. One may wonder
the role of a market- maker in the computerised system , as investors can transact directly without a third
party. The market-maker’s role here is to ensure supply of stocks at any given point in time. Market-makers
are helpful as they are always ready to buy or sell as long as investors are willing to pay the price quoted by them.
# SECURITIES LENDING
This method is regulated by SEBI which introduced guidelines in 1997 for this purpose. Under the scheme, a
person with idle shares can lend them to another who does not have the shares to fulfill his obligation under a
trade finalised by him. There will be no direct contacts between the borrower and lender of securities. An
intermediary who can guarantee the scheme and make good the loss in the borrower who fails to honour his
obligations can alone provide substance to the scheme. The borrower has to put up collateral for his borrowings
and pay cash margin levied on the securities by the authorities. Income from securities lending is exempt from Capital Gains Tax.
SECURITIES’ LENDINGAND BORROWING (‘SLB’)
Securities’ Lending and Borrowing (‘SLB’) describes the market practice whereby securities are temporarily
transferred by one party (the lender) to another (the borrower) via an approved intermediary.
The Borrower is obliged to return them either on demand or at the end of an agreed term and also has an option
to early return. Lender may recall securities at any time within normal market settlement cycle. SLB is a major
and growing activity which provides significant benefits for issuers, investors and traders alike. SLB helps in
improving market liquidity, more efficient settlement, tighter dealer prices and perhaps a reduction in the cost of capital.
Why participate in Securities Lending & Borrowing ? • Lender’s Motivation
- It provides lender incremental return on an idle portfolio. • Borrower’s Motivation
- To cover a short position: avoidance of settlement failure.
- Hedging of futures & options positions.
- Borrow and lend to reap benefits of the market sentiment.

# SHORT SELLING AND SECURITIES LENDING AND BORROWING
SEBI vide Circular no MRD/DoP/SE/Dep/Cir- 14 /2007 dated December 20, 2007 permitted all classes of investors
to short sell subject to the broad framework specified there in which are enumerated as follows. Broad Framework for Short Selling
– “Short selling” shall be defined as selling a stock which the seller does not own at the time of trade.
– All classes of investors, viz., retail and institutional investors, shall be permitted to short sell.
– Naked short selling shall not be permitted in the Indian securities market and accordingly, all investors
would be required to mandatorily honour their obligation of delivering the securities at the time of settlement.
– No institutional investor shall be allowed to do day trading i.e., square-of their transactions intra-day. In
other words, all transactions would be grossed for institutional investors at the custodians’ level and the
institutions would be required to fulfill their obligations on a gross basis.
– The custodians, however, would continue to settle their deliveries on a net basis with the stock exchanges.
– The stock exchanges shall frame necessary uniform deterrent provisions and take appropriate action
against the brokers for failure to deliver securities at the time of settlement which shall act as a sufficient deterrent against failure to deliver.
– A scheme for Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) shall be put in place to provide the necessary
impetus to short sell. The introduction of fullfledged securities lending and borrowing scheme shall be
simultaneous with the introduction of short selling by institutional investors.
– The securities traded in Future and Option (F&O) segment shall be eligible for short selling.
– SEBI may review the list of stocks that are eligible for short selling transactions from time to time.
– The institutional investors shall disclose upfront at the time of placement of order whether the transaction
is a short sale. However, retail investors would be permitted to make a similar disclosure by the end of
the trading hours on the transaction day.
– The brokers shall be mandated to collect the details on scrip-wise short sell positions, collate the data
and upload it to the stock exchanges before the commencement of trading on the following trading day.
The stock exchanges shall then consolidate such information and disseminate the same on their websites
for the information of the public on a weekly basis.
– The frequency of such disclosure may be reviewed from time to time with the approval of SEBI.
Broad Framework for Securities Lending and Borrowing
– In order to provide a mechanism for borrowing of securities to enable settlement of securities sold short,
the stock exchanges shall put in place, a full fledged securities lending and borrowing(SLB) scheme,
within the overall framework of “Securities Lending Scheme, 1997” (the scheme), that is open for all
market participants in the Indian securities market.
– To begin with, the SLB shall be operated through Clearing Corporation/ Clearing House of stock
exchanges having nation-wide terminals who will be registered as Approved Intermediaries (AIs) under the SLS, 1997.
– Eligible scrips for SLB: In addition to the scrips on which derivatives contracts are available, scrips that
fulfill the following criteria shall be considered eligible for SLB:
```
(a) Scrip classified as ‘Group I security’ as per SEBI circular MRD/DoP/SE/Cir-07/2005 dated February 23, 2005;
```

## Page 104

80 EP-CM&SL
# AND
```
(b) Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL) of the scrip, as defined at para 12 (a) of Annexure 2 of the
```
MRD/DoP/SE/Dep/Cir-14/2007 dated December 20, 2007, shall not be less than Rs.100 crores;
# AND
```
(c) Average monthly trading turnover in the scrip in the Cash Market shall not be less than Rs.100 crores in the previous six months.
```
– Event a scrip fails to meet the eligibility criteria, no new SLB transaction shall be allowed in the scrip
from the next trading day. However, the existing contracts in such scrips shall be allowed to continue till expiry.
– The collateral to be accepted for meeting margin obligations related to SLB transactions shall be in the
same form as applicable in the Cash Market.
– The SLB shall take place on an automated, screen based, order-matching platform which will be provided
by the AIs. This platform shall be independent of the other trading platforms.
– To begin with, the securities traded in F&O segment shall be eligible for lending & borrowing under the scheme.
– Any lender or borrower who wishes to extend an existing lent or borrow position shall be permitted to
roll-over such positions i.e. a lender who is due to receive securities in the pay out of an SLB session,
may extend the period of lending. Similarly, a borrower who has to return borrowed securities in the pay-
in of an SLB session, may, through the same SLB session, extend the period of borrowing. The roll-over
shall be conducted as part of the SLB session.
– Rollover shall not permit netting of counter positions, i.e. netting between the ‘borrowed’ and ‘lent’ positions of a client.
– Roll-over shall be available for a period of 3 months i.e. the original contract plus 2 rollover contracts.
– Liquid Index Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) shall be eligible for trading in the SLB segment.

### Settlement System
Settlement is the process of netting of transactions and actual delivery/receipt of securities and transfer deeds
against receipts/payment of agreed amount. It is necessary to make a settlement to know the net effect of a
series of transactions during a given period.
Settlement date is the date specified for delivery of securities between securities firms. For administrative
convenience, a stock exchange divides the year into a number of settlement periods so as to enable members
to settle their trades. All transactions executed during the settlement period are settled at the end of the settlement period.
Settlement risk or principal risk is the risk that the seller of a security or funds delivers its obligation but does not
receive payment or that the buyer of a security or funds makes payment but does not receive delivery. In this
event, the full principal value of the securities or funds transferred is at risk.

82 EP-CM&SL FAQ’s on Settlement Cycle
# UNDERSTANDING TRADE SETTLEMENT CYCLE
India is one of the most advanced markets when it comes to settlement of trade. The domestic market follows
a T+2 settlement cycle. India is one of the most advanced markets when it comes to settlement of trade. WHAT IS ROLLING SETTLEMENT?
In a rolling settlement, each trading day is considered as a trading period and trades executed during the
day are settled based on net obligations for the day. In India, trades in rolling settlement are settled on a T+2
basis i.e. on the 2nd working day after a trade.
WHICH DAYSARE CALCULATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ROLLING SETTLEMENT?
For arriving at the settlement day, all intervening holidays, which include bank holidays, exchange holidays,
Saturdays and Sundays, are excluded. Typically, trades taking place on Monday are settled on Wednesday,
Tuesday’s trades are settled on Thursday and so on.
WHEN DOES THE OPEN POSITIONS RESULT IN PAYMENT/ DELIVERY UNDER ROLLING SETTLEMENT?
Under rolling settlement, all open positions at the end of the day mandatorily result in payment/ delivery ‘n’
days later. Currently, trades in rolling settlement are settled on T+2 basis where T is the trade day. For
example, a trade executed on Monday is mandatorily settled by Wednesday (considering two working days from the trade day). Settlement Cycle for Rolling Settlement
Activity Day Trading Rolling settlement T
Clearing Custodial confirmation and delivery generation T+1 working days
Settlement Securities and funds pay-in and pay-out T+2 working days
Post settlement Auction T+3 working days Bad delivery reporting T+4 working days Auction settlement T+5 working days
Rectified bad delivery pay-in and pay-out T+6 working days
Re-bad delivery reporting and pick up T+8 working days
Close out of re-bad delivery and funds pay-in and pay-out T+9 working days
For intraday traders, rolling settlement changes nothing. For institutional investors , who are forbidden to
square off anyway, there would be no change. It is for retail investors who take leveraged positions across
one night or more that rolling settlement has an impact. The funds and securities pay-in and pay-out are carried out on T+2 days WHAT IS PAY-IN AND PAY-OUT?
Pay-in day is the day when the securities sold are delivered to the exchange by the sellers and funds for the
securities purchased are made available to the exchange by the buyers. Pay-out day is the day the securities
purchased are delivered to the buyers and the funds for the securities sold are given to the sellers by the
exchange. At present, the pay-in and pay-out happens on the 2nd working day after the trade is executed
on the exchange, that is settlement cycle is on T+2 rolling settlement.
|  | Activity | Day |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trading | Rolling settlement | T |
| Clearing | Custodial confirmation and delivery generation | T+1 working days |
| Settlement | Securities and funds pay-in and pay-out | T+2 working days |
| Post settlement | Auction | T+3 working days |
|  | Bad delivery reporting | T+4 working days |
|  | Auction settlement | T+5 working days |
|  | Rectified bad delivery pay-in and pay-out | T+6 working days |
|  | Re-bad delivery reporting and pick up | T+8 working days |
|  | Close out of re-bad delivery and funds pay-in and pay-out | T+9 working days |

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 83 WHAT IS NO-DELIVERY PERIOD?
Whenever a company announces a book closure or record date, the exchange set up a no-delivery period
for that security. During this period only trading is permitted in the security. However, these trades are
settled only after the no-delivery period is over. This is done to ensure that investor’s entitlement for the
corporate benefit is clearly determined. WHAT IS AN AUCTION?
On account of non-delivery of securities by the trading member on the pay-in day, securities are put up for
auction by the exchange. This ensures that buying trading member receives the securities. The Exchange
purchases the requisite quantity in auction market and gives them to the buying trading member. BOMBAY STOCK EXCHANGE LTD.
Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd., popularly known as "BSE" was established in 1875 as "The Native Share and Stock
Brokers Association". It is the oldest one in Asia, even older than the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which was established
in 1878. It is a voluntary non-profit making Association of Persons (AOP) and is currently engaged in the process
of converting itself into demutualised and corporate entity. It has evolved over the years into its present status as
the premier Stock Exchange in the country. It is the first Stock Exchange in the Country to have obtained permanent
recognition in 1956 from the Govt. of India under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956.
The Exchange, provides market for trading in securities, debt and derivatives upholds the interests of the investors
and ensures redressal of their grievances whether against the companies or its own member-brokers. It also
strives to educate and enlighten the investors by conducting investor education programmes and making available to them necessary informative inputs. Trading at BSE
The scrips traded on BSE have been classified into various groups.
BSE has, for the guidance and benefit of the investors, classified the scrips in the Equity Segment into A, B, E,
P, T, XC, XD, XT, Z, F, G and M/MT groups on certain qualitative and quantitative parameters.
“A” Group It is the most tracked class of scripts consisting of about 200 scripts. Market
capitalization is one key factor in deciding which scrip should be classified in Group A.
“B” Group Represents of two scrips “B1” which consists of scrips relatively liquid and with good
track record. “B2” which consists of scrips with comparatively low liquidity.
“F” Group Represents the fixed income securities
“G” Group Represents trading in Government Securities by the retail investors
“T” Group Represents scrips which are settled on a trade-to-trade basis as a surveillance measure
“Z” Group Includes companies which have failed to comply with its listing requirements and/or
have failed to resolve investor complaints and/or have not made the required
arrangements with the Depositories, for dematerialization of their securities.
With effect from December 31, 2001, trading in all securities listed in equity in the Equity segment takes place in
one market segment, viz., Compulsory Rolling Settlement (CRS) Segment.
The securities of companies which are in demat can be traded in market lot of 1. However, the securities of
companies which are still in the physical form are traded in the market lot of generally either 50 or 100. Investors
having quantities of securities less than the market lot are required to sell them as “Odd Lots”. This facility offers
an exit route to investors to dispose off their odd lots of securities, and also provides them an opportunity to
consolidate their securities into market lots.
| “A” Group | It is the most tracked class of scripts consisting of about 200 scripts. Market
capitalization is one key factor in deciding which scrip should be classified in Group A. |
| --- | --- |
| “B” Group | Represents of two scrips “B1” which consists of scrips relatively liquid and with good

This facility of selling physical shares in compulsory demat scrips is called as Exit Route Scheme. This facility
can also be used by small investors for selling up to 500 shares in physical form in respect of scrips of companies
where trades are required to be compulsorily settled by all investors in demat mode.
BSE, in respect of securities of companies that are only listed/traded at BSE, considering their specific
characteristics such a large number of companies, low to underrate market capitalization, lawyer contribution to
overall trading turnover, classified equity securities of companies that are only listed/traded at BSE and satisfy
certain paramount into separate sub-segments called “XC”, “XD” and “XT”. At the time of reviews any securities
falling in Trade-for-Trade Segment (DT or “T” groups) are classified under “XT” sub-segments.
Computation of Closing Price of Scrips in the Cash Segment
The closing price of scrips is computed by the Exchange on the basis of weighted average price of all trades
executed during the last 30 minutes of the continuous trading session. However, if there is no trade recorded
during the last 30 minutes, then the last traded price of a scrip in the continuous trading session is taken as the official closing price.
# BASKET TRADING SYSTEM
The Exchange commenced trading in the Derivatives Segment with effect from June 9, 2000 to enable the
investors to, inter-alia, hedge their risks. Initially, the facility of trading in the Derivatives Segment was confined
to Index Futures. Subsequently, the Exchange introduced the Index Options and Options & Futures in select
individual stocks. The investors in cash market had felt a need to limit their risk exposure in the market to movement in Sensex.
With a view to provide investors the facility of creating Sensex linked portfolios and also to create a linkage of
market prices of the underlying securities of Sensex in the Cash Segment and Futures on Sensex, the Exchange
has provided to the investors as well its member-brokers, a facility of Basket Trading System on BOLT. In the Basket Trading System :
– The investors through the member-brokers of the exchange are able to buy/sell all 30 scrips of Sensex
in one go in the proportion of their respective weights in the Sensex.
– The investors can create their own baskets by deleting certain scrips from 30 scrips in the Sensex and
also a place orders by entering value of Sensex portfolio to be bought or sold with a minimum value of 50,000/- for each order.
– The investors can alter the weights of securities in such profiled baskets and enter their own weights.
The investors can also select less than 100% weightage to reduce the value of the basket as per their own requirements.
– To participate in this system, the member-brokers need to indicate number of Sensex basket(s) to be
bought or sold, where the value of one Sensex basket is arrived at by the system by multiplying 50 to
prevailing Sensex. Example: if the Sensex is 19,000, then value of one basket of Sensex would be 19,000 x 50 = i.e., 9, 50,000.
– It provides the arbitrageurs an opportunity to take advantage of price differences in the underlying
Sensex and Futures on the Sensex by simultaneous buying and selling of baskets comprising the
Sensex scrips in the Cash Segment and Sensex Futures.
– It meets the need of investors and also improves the depth in cash and futures markets.

# SETTLEMENT SYSTEMAT BSE
### Compulsory Rolling Settlement
All transactions in all groups of securities in the Equity segment and Fixed Income securities listed on BSE are
required to be settled on T+2 basis (w.e.f. April 1, 2003). The settlement calendar, which indicates the dates of
the various settlement related activities, is drawn by BSE in advance and is circulated among the market participants.
Under rolling settlements, the trades done on a particular day are settled after a given number of business days.
A T+2 settlement cycle means that the final settlement of transactions done on T, i.e., trade day by exchange of
monies and securities between the buyers and sellers respectively takes place on second business day (excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, bank and Exchange trading holidays) after the trade day.
The transactions in securities of companies which have made arrangements for dematerialization of their securities
are settled only in demat mode on T+2 on net basis, i.e., buy and sell positions of a member-broker in the same
scrip are netted and the net quantity and value is required to be settled. However, transactions in securities of
companies, which are in “Z” group or have been placed under “trade-to-trade” by BSE as a surveillance measure
```
(“T” ), are settled only on a gross basis and the facility of netting of buy and sell transactions in such scrips is not available.
```
The transaction in “F” group securities representing “Fixed Income Securities” and “G” group representing
Government Securities for retail investors are also settled at BSE on T+2 basis.
Thus, the pay-in and pay-out of funds and securities takes places on the second business day (i.e., excluding
Saturday, Sunday and bank & Exchange trading holidays) of the day of the execution of the trade.
The Information Systems Department of the Exchange generates, inter-alia, the following statements, which
can be downloaded by the member-brokers in their back offices on a daily basis.
```
(a) Statements giving details of the daily transactions entered into by the member-brokers.
```
```
(b) Statements giving details of margins payable by the member-brokers in respect of the trades executed by them.
```
```
(c) Statements of securities and fund obligation.
```
```
(d) Delivery/Receive orders for delivery/receipt of securities.
```
The settlement of the trades (money and securities) done by a member-broker on his own account or on behalf
of his individual, corporate or institutional clients may be either through the member-broker himself or through a
SEBI registered custodian appointed by him/client. In case the delivery/payment in respect of a transaction
executed by a member-broker is to be given or taken by a registered custodian, then the latter has to confirm the
trade done by a member-broker on the BOLT System through 6A-7A entry. In case a transaction done by a
member-broker is not confirmed by a registered custodian within the time permitted, the liability for pay-in of
funds or securities in respect of the same devolves on the concerned member-broker. 6A/7A
A mechanism whereby the obligation of settling the transactions done by a member-broker on behalf of a
client is passed on to a custodian based on confirmation of latter. The custodian can confirm the trades done
by the member-brokers on-line and upto 11 a.m. on the next trading day. The late confirmation of transactions
by the custodian after 11:00 a.m. upto 12:15 p.m., on the next trading day is, however, permitted subject to
payment of charges for late confirmation @ 0.01% of the value of trades confirmed or ` 10,000/-, whichever is less.

Pay-in and Pay-out for 'A', 'B', 'T', 'C', 'F', 'G' & 'Z' group of securities
The trades done on BOLT by the Members in all securities in Compulsory rolling settlement (CRS) are now
settled on BSE by payment of monies and delivery of securities on T+2 basis. All deliveries of securities are
required to be routed through the Clearing House.
The Pay-in/Pay-out of funds based on the money statement and that of securities based on Delivery Order/
Receiver Order issued by BSE are settled on T+2 day. Demat pay-in
The member-brokers can effect pay-in of demat securities to the Clearing House either through the National
Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL) or Central Depository Services (I) Ltd. (CDSL). In case of NSDL, the member-
brokers are required to give instructions to their respective Depository Participants (DPs) specifying settlement
no., settlement type, effective pay-in date, quantity, etc.
As regards CDSL, the member-brokers give pay-in instructions to their respective DPs. The securities are
transferred by the DPs to the Clearing Member (CM) Principal Account. The member-brokers are required to
give confirmation to their DPs, so that securities are processed towards pay-in obligations. Alternatively, the
member-brokers may also effect pay-in from the clients' beneficiary accounts. For this, the clients are required
to mention the settlement details and clearing member-broker ID of the member-broker through whom they
have sold the securities. Thus, in such cases the Clearing Members are not required to give any delivery
instructions from their accounts. In case a member fails to deliver the securities, the value of shares delivered
short is recovered from him at the standard/closing rate of the scrips in the trading day. Auto delivery facility
Instead of issuing Delivery instructions for their securities delivery obligations in demat mode in various scrips in
a settlement /auction, a facility has been made available to the member-brokers of automatically generating
Delivery instructions on their behalf from their CM Pool accounts maintained with NSDL and CM Principal
Accounts maintained with CDSL. This auto delivery facility is available for CRS (Normal & Auction) and for trade
to trade settlements. This facility is, however, not available for delivery of non-pari passu shares and shares
having multiple International Securities Identification Number (ISINs). The member-brokers wishing to avail of
this facility have to submit an authority letter to the Clearing House. This auto delivery facility is currently available
for Clearing Member (CM) Pool accounts and Principal accounts maintained by the member-brokers with National
Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL) and Central Depositories Services (I) Ltd. (CDSL) respectively. Pay-in of securities in physical form
In case of delivery of securities in physical form, the member-brokers have to deliver the securities to the
Clearing House in special closed pouches along with the relevant details like distinctive numbers, scrip code,
quantity, etc., on a floppy. The data submitted by the member-brokers on floppies is matched against the master
file data on the Clearing House computer systems. If there is no discrepancy, then a scroll number is generated
by the Clearing House and the securities are accepted. Funds Pay-in
Once the reconciliation of securities is completed by the Clearing House, the bank accounts of member-brokers
maintained with the ten clearing banks, are directly debited through computerized posting for their funds settlement
obligations. Once the pay-in of securities and funds is complete, the Clearing House arranges for the pay-out of securities and funds.
In case of those members, whose funds pay-in obligations are returned by their clearing banks on account of
insufficient funds in their bank accounts at the time of pay-in, their BOLT TWSs are now immediately de-activated
during the trading hours itself, on receipt of such intimation from the clearing banks as against the earlier

## Page 111

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 87
practice of de-activating their BOLT TWSs at the end of trading on that day. BOLT TWSs of such members
remain de-activated till the pay-in obligations are cleared by them. Securities Pay-out
In case of demat securities, the same are credited by the Clearing House in the Pool/Principal Accounts of the
member-brokers. The Exchange has also provided a facility to the member-brokers for transfer of pay-out
securities directly to the clients' beneficiary owner accounts without routing the same through their Pool/Principal
accounts in NSDL/CDSL. For this, the concerned member-brokers are required to give a client wise break up
file which is uploaded by the member-brokers from their offices to the Clearing House. Based on the break up
given by the member-brokers, the Clearing House instructs depositories, viz., CDSL & NSDL to credit the
securities to the Beneficiary Owners (BO) Accounts of the clients. In case delivery of securities received from
one depository is to be credited to an account in the other depository, the Clearing House does an inter depository
transfer to give effect to such transfers.
In case of physical securities, the Receiving Members are required to collect the same from the Clearing House on the pay-out day.
This process of passing on delivery of securities purchased by the member-brokers to them by the Clearing House is called pay-out of securities.
### Funds Payout
The bank accounts of the member-brokers having pay-out of funds are credited by the Clearing House with the
Clearing Banks on the same day. This process is referred to as Pay-out of Funds.
In case, if a member-broker fails to deliver the securities, then the value of shares delivered short is recovered
from him at the standard/closing rate of the scrips on the trading day.
In case of Rolling Settlements, pay-in and pay-out of both funds and securities, as stated earlier, is completed on the same day.
The settlement calendar, which indicates the dates of the various settlement related activities, is drawn by the
Exchange in advance on a quarterly basis and is circulated among the market participants. The settlement
calendars so drawn have been strictly adhered to by the Exchange and there has been generally no case of
clubbing of settlements or postponement of pay-in and/ or pay-out during the last over seven years.
The Exchange maintains database of fake/forged, stolen, lost and duplicate securities in physical form with the
Clearing House so that distinctive numbers submitted by member-brokers in case of physical securities on
delivery may be matched against the database to weed out bad paper from circulation at the time of introduction
of such securities in the market. This database has also been made available to the member-brokers so that
both delivering and receiving member-brokers can check the entry of fake, forged and stolen shares in the market. Surveillance at BSE
The main objective of the Surveillance function of the exchange is to promote market integrity in two ways:-
## 1. By monitoring price and volume movements (volatility) as well as by detecting potential market abuses at a nascent stage, and
## 2. By managing default risk by taking necessary actions timely.
All the instruments traded in the equity segment of Cash and Derivative market come under the Surveillance
umbrella of BSE. Surveillance activities at the Exchange are divided broadly into two major segments, namely,
price monitoring and position monitoring.

## Page 112

88 EP-CM&SL
The detailed explanation of the various Surveillance activities are as follows : (a) Price Monitoring
The functioning of the Price Monitoring is broadly divided into following activities: (i) On-Line Surveillance (ii) Off-Line Surveillance (iii) Derivative Market Surveillance (iv) Investigations (v) Surveillance Actions (vi) Rumour Verification (vii) Pro-active Measures (i) On line Surveillance
One of the most important tools of the Surveillance is the On-line Real Time Surveillance system which was
commissioned in 1999 with main objectives of detecting potential market abuses at a nascent stage to reduce
the ability of the market participants to unduly influence the price and volumes of the scrips traded at the
Exchange, improve the risk management system and strengthen the self regulatory mechanism at the Exchange.
The system has a facility to generate the alerts on-line, in real time, based on certain preset parameters like
price and volume variations in scrips, members taking unduly large positions not commensurate with their
financial position or having large concentrated position(s) in one or few scrips, etc. (ii) Off-Line Surveillance
The Off-Line Surveillance system comprises of the various reports based on different parameters and scrutiny thereof. – High/Low Difference in prices
– % change in prices over a week/fortnight/month – Top N scrips by Turnover – Trading in infrequently traded scrips – Scrips hitting New High/Low
The Surveillance actions or investigations are initiated in the scrips identified from the above-stated reports. (iii) Derivative Market Surveillance Areas of Focus
– Abnormal fluctuation in the prices of a series
– Market Movement (Cash vis-a-vis Derivative)
– Member Concentration (Cash vis-a-vis Derivative)
– Closing Price Manipulation (Cash & Derivative) (iv) Investigations
The Exchange conducts in-depth investigations based on preliminary enquiries/ analysis made into trading of
the scrip as also at the instance of SEBI. In case irregularities observed, necessary actions are initiated and/or
investigation case forwarded to SEBI, if necessary.

## Page 113

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 89 (v) Surveillance Actions
### Special Margins
Special margins are imposed on scrips which have witnessed abnormal price/ volume movements. Special
margin is imposed @ 25 % or 50 % or 75 % as the case may be, on the client wise net outstanding purchase or
sale position (or on both side) by the department. Reduction of Circuit Filters
The circuit filters are reduced in case of illiquid scrips or as a price containment measure in low volume scrips.
The circuit filters are reduced to 10 % or 5 % or 2 % as the case may be, based on the criteria decided by the Exchange.
### Circuit Breakers
In addition to the price bands on individual scrips, SEBI decided to implement index based market wide circuit
breakers system, w.e.f., July 02, 2001.The circuit breakers are applicable at three stages of the index movement
either way at 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. These circuit breakers will bring about a coordinated trading halt in both Equity and Derivative market. Trade to Trade
If a scrip is shifted on a Trade-to trade settlement basis, selling/ buying of shares in that scrip would result into
giving/ taking delivery of shares at the gross level and no intra day/ settlement netting off/ square off facility
would be permitted. The scrips which form part of 'Z group' are compulsorily settled on a trade to trade settlement
basis. In addition to that Surveillance department transfers various scrips from time to time on a trade to trade
settlement basis to contain the excessive volatility and/or abnormal volumes in the scrip. Suspension of a scrip
The scrips are suspended by the Surveillance department in exceptional cases pending investigation or if the
same scrip is suspended by any other Stock Exchange as a Surveillance action. Warning to Members
The department may issue verbal/ written warning to member/s when market manipulation in the scrip is suspected.
Imposition of penalty/suspension/de-activation of terminals
The department imposes penalty or deactivate BOLT terminals or suspend the member/s who are involved in
market manipulation, based on the input/ evidence available from investigation report or as and when directed by SEBI. (vi) Rumour Verification
The following steps are involved in Rumour verification process:
– Surveillance Department liaises with Compliance Officers of companies to obtain comments of the
company on various price sensitive corporate news items appearing in the selected News Papers.
– Comments received from the companies are disseminated to the Market by way of BOLT Ticker and/ or Notices in the Bulletin.
– Show cause notices are issued to companies which do not reply promptly to the Exchange.
– Investigations based on rumour verifications are carried out, if required, to detect cases of suspected insider trading

## Page 114

90 EP-CM&SL (vii) Pro-active Measures
– The Department compiled and disseminated a list of companies who have changed their names to
suggest that their business interest is in the software Industry.
– List of NBFC's, whose application for registration rejected by RBI, was compiled and disseminated by the department. (b) Position Monitoring
```
(i) Statement of Top 100 Purchasers/Sellers (ii) Concentrated Purchases/Sales
```
```
(iii) Purchases/Sales of Scrips having Thin Trading
```
```
(iv) Trading in B1, B2 and Z group Scrips
```
```
(v) Pay-in liabilities above a Threshold Limit
```
```
(vi) Verification of Institutional Trades (vii) Snap Investigation (viii) Market Intelligence
```
The Surveillance Department closely monitors outstanding exposure of members on a daily basis. For this purpose,
it has developed various off-line and on-line market monitoring reports. The reports are scrutinised to ascertain
whether there is excessive purchase or sale position build up as compared to the normal business of the member,
whether there are concentrated purchases or sales, whether the purchases have been made by inactive or financially
weak members and even the quality of scrips is considered to assess the quality of exposure. Based on analysis
of the above factors and the margins already paid and the capital deposited by the member, ad-hoc margins/early
pay-in calls are made, if required. Some members are even advised to reduce their outstanding exposure in the
market. Trading restrictions are placed on their business as and when deemed fit.
The department thus executes the Risk Management functions to avert possible payment default of members by taking timely corrective measures.
The following key areas are examined to assess the market risk involved.
```
(i) Statement of Top 100 Purchasers/Sellers
```
Statements of top 100 net purchasers and top 100 net sellers in case of A, B1, B2 and Z group of scrips are
scrutinized, on a daily basis. This enables the Department to keep a watch on the exposure of the members,
ascertain the quality of exposures, measure the risk vis-a-vis cover available by way of margins, capital etc. and
initiate action such as imposition of ad-hoc margins, trading restriction etc. on the members.
A detailed report on the net outstanding positions of top purchasers and top sellers with exposures in individual
scrips above certain limit, margin cover available etc., is prepared on a daily basis. (ii) Concentrated Purchases/Sales
The concentration in purchases/sales of a member in a few scrips could be considered risky. In case, such a
situation is noticed, fundamentals of the scrips, their daily turnover, their nature of transactions is ascertained.
Thereafter, based on the market risk perception appropriate surveillance actions are taken.
```
(iii) Purchases/Sales of Scrips having Thin Trading
```
Purchases/sales by members in scrips having thin trading is closely scrutinised as comparatively high market
risk is involved in trading in such scrips. Details of trades in such scrips are called from the members to assess
the market risk involved and decide on the appropriate surveillance action.

## Page 115

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 91
```
(iv) Trading in B1, B2 and Z Group Scrips
```
The Exchange has classified the scrips listed on the Exchange into 'A', 'B1', 'B2' and 'Z' groups. In view of the
price manipulation witnessed in a few B1, B2 and Z group scrips and also as a risk management measure, the
Exchange has prescribed Exposure limits in B1, B2 and Z group scrips in a single Rolling Settlement.
```
(v) Pay-in liabilities of members above a threshold limit
```
The pay-in liability of members above a certain threshold limit is monitored with respect to the pay-in amount of
the members, the members capital, the margin cover available to the Exchange against the members pay-in
liability, etc. In case of inadequate margin cover, the reasons of the pay-in are ascertained. If warranted, advance
pay-in is called to ensure that pay-in is completed smoothly.
```
(vi) Verification of Institutional Trade
```
The institutional trades executed by the member-brokers are verified to ascertain the genuineness of trades. (vii) Snap Investigation
The Department also carries out, wherever considered necessary, preliminary investigation of certain dealings
to verify irregularities. Further actions, viz., referring the case for detailed investigations, referring the cases to
the Disciplinary Action Committee (DAC) of the Exchange for taking disciplinary action against members, referring
cases to the Scrutiny Committee of the Exchange to re-assess the financial soundness of the members etc., are
taken depending on the findings of preliminary investigation. (viii) Market Intelligence
The rumours floating in the market are verified with the data available with the Exchange. Newspapers, Television
news channels are referred to ascertain the national and global factors affecting the market sentiments. This
enables the Exchange to avert market problems before it causes a serious damage.
On assessment of the market risk, decisions to call ad-hoc margins/early pay-in, advising the member to limit
his business, summoning him for explanation, placing trading restriction, deactivation of BOLT TWS, etc. are taken.
### Market Abuse
Market abuse is a broad term which includes abnormal price/ volume movement, artificial transactions, false or
misleading impressions, insider trading, etc. In order to detect aberrant behaviour/ movement, it is necessary to
know the normal market behaviour. The department uses various tools to determine normal and abnormal
market behaviour. The necessary actions are initiated like imposition of special margin, reduction of circuit
filters, trade to trade settlement, suspensions, de-activation of terminals, etc. to control abnormal market behaviour.
The department carries out investigation, if necessary, based on the preliminary examination/analysis and suitable
actions are taken against members involved based on the investigation.
NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE OF INDIA LTD. (NSEIL)
Based on Pherwani Committees report submitted in June, 1991, the National Stock Exchange of India Limited
```
(NSEIL) was established to provide an efficient system eliminating all the deficiencies of stock exchanges and is
```
geared to meet the requirements of the large investor population. It is a single stock exchange and all other
centres are electronically linked to this exchange.
NSEIL was promoted by leading FIs at the behest of Government of India and was incorporated in November
1992 as a tax-paying company unlike other stock exchanges in the country. On its recognition as a stock
exchange under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 in April 1993, NSEIL commenced operations in
the Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment in June 1994, operations in the Capital Market (CM) segment in
November 1994, and operations in derivatives segment in June 2000.

## Page 116

92 EP-CM&SL
### Capital Market Segment
The Capital Market (CM) segment of NSEIL provides a fully automated screen based trading system for trading
of equity and preference shares, debentures, warrants and coupons. The trading system, known as the National
Exchange for Automated Trading (NEAT) system, is an anonymous order-driven system and operates on a
strict price/time priority. It enables members from across the country to trade simultaneously with enormous
ease and efficiency. It provides tremendous flexibility to the users in terms of kinds of orders that can be placed
on the system. Several time-related (Good-till-Cancelled, Good-till-Day, Immediate-or-Cancel), price-related
```
(buy/sell limit and stop-loss orders) or volume related (All-or-None, Minimum Fill, etc.) conditions can be easily
```
built into an order. Orders are sorted and matched automatically by the computer keeping the system transparent,
objective and fair. The trading system also provides complete market information on-line, which is updated on real time basis.
### Wholesale Debt Market Segment
The WDM segment provides the only formal trading platform for trading of a wide range of debt securities.
Initially, government securities, treasury bills and bonds issued by public sector undertakings (PSUs) were
made available for trading. This range has been widened to include non-traditional instruments like floating rate
bonds, zero coupon bonds, index bonds, commercial papers, certificates of deposit, corporate debentures,
state government loans, SLR and non-SLR bonds issued by financial institutions, units of mutual funds and securitised debt.
The WDM trading system, known as NEAT (National Exchange for Automated Trading), is a fully automated
screen based trading system that enables members across the country to trade simultaneously with enormous
ease and efficiency. The trading system is an order driven system, which matches best buy and sell orders on a price/time priority.
Trading system provides two market sub-types: continous market and negotiated market. In continuous market,
the buyer and seller do not know each other and they put their best buy/sell orders, which are stored in order
book with price/time priority. If orders match, it results into a trade. The trades in WDM segment are settled
directly between the participants, who take an exposure to the settlement risk attached to any unknown counterparty.
In the negotiated market, the trades are normally decided by the seller and the buyer, and reported to the
Exchange through the broker. Thus deals negotiated or structured outside the exchange are disclosed to the
market through NEAT-WDM system. In negotiated market, as buyers and sellers know each other and have
agreed to trade, no counter-party exposure limit needs to be invoked.
The trades on the WDM segment could be either outright trades or repo transactions with flexibility for varying
days of settlement (T+0 to T+2) and repo periods (1 to 14 days). For every trade, it is necessary to specify the
number of settlement days and the trade type (repo or non-repo) and in the event of a repo trade, the repo term.
The Futures and Option trading system, called NEAT-F&O trading system, provides a fully automated screen-
based trading for S&P CNX Nifty futures on a nationwide basis and an online monitoring and surveillance mechanism.
The NEAT-F&O trading system is accessed by two types of users. The Trading Member (TM) has access to
functions such as, order entry, order matching, order and trade management. The Clearing Member (CM) uses
the trader workstation for the purpose of monitoring the trading member(s) for whom he clears the trades.
Additionally, he can enter and set limits to position, which a trading member can take.
### Contracts
Futures contract on the NSEIL is based on S&P CNX Nifty Index. Currently, it has a maximum of 3-month

## Page 117

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 93
expiration cycle. Three contracts are available for trading with 1 month, 2 months and 3 months expiry. A new
contract is introduced on the next trading day following the expiry of the near month contract. Various conditions
like, Good-till-Day, Good-till-Cancelled, Good-till- Date, Immediate or Cancel, Stop loss, etc. can be built into an order. Clearing and Settlement
NSCCL undertakes clearing and settlement of all deals executed on the NSEIL’s Derivatives segment. It acts as
legal counterparty to all deals on the Derivatives segment and guarantees settlement.
### Derivatives Segment
In the Derivatives segment, NSCCL has admitted Clearing Members (CMs) distinct from Trading Members
```
(TMs) in line with the 2-tier membership structure stipulated by SEBI to enable wider participation in the Derivatives
```
segment. All trades on the Derivatives segment are cleared through a CM of NSCCL.
Nifty index futures contracts are cash settled, i.e. through exchange of cash differences in value. Settlement is
done on a daily basis by marking to market all open positions on the basis of the daily settlement price. The
contracts are finally settled on expiry of the Nifty index futures contract when NSCCL marks the open positions
of a CM to the closing price of the underlying index and resulting profit/loss is settled in cash.
# TRADING AND SETTLEMENT AT NSE
NSE introduced for the first time in India, fully automated screen based trading. It uses a modern, fully computerised
trading system designed to offer investors across the length and breadth of the country a safe and easy way to invest.
The NSE trading system called 'National Exchange for Automated Trading' (NEAT) is a fully automated screen
based trading system, which adopts the principle of an order driven market.
National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL)
This company incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited
carries out clearing and settlement of the trades executed in the capital market segment of National Stock
Exchange. This company completes the settlement promptly without delay or deferment. It operates on behalf
of the clearing members from and to regional clearing centres and central clearing centres at Mumbai. It was the
first organisation to start pre-delivery verification to detect bad papers in the form of fake or forged certificates or
lost and stolen share certificates through the automated mechanism of the clearing corporation. A facility is
provided to lend/borrow securities as well as funds at market determined rates and enables timely delivery of
securities with efficiency. This corporation is connected to National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and
Central Depositories Services (India) Limited (CDSL) and carries out clearing and settlement services for other exchanges as well as for Index Futures.
### Clearing Mechanism
Trades in rolling segment are cleared and settled on a netted basis. Trading and settlement periods are specified
by the Exchange/Clearing Corporation from time to time. Deals executed during a particular trading period are
netted at the end of that trading period and settlement obligations for that settlement period are computed. A
multilateral netting procedure is adopted to determine the net settlement obligations.
In a rolling settlement, each trading day is considered as a trading period and trades executed during the day
are netted to obtain the net obligations for the day.
Trade-for-trade deals and Limited Physical Market deals are settled on a trade for trade basis and settlement obligations arise out of every deal.

## Page 118

94 EP-CM&SL Clearing & Settlement (Equities)
NSCCL carries out clearing and settlement functions as per the settlement cycles of different sub-segments in the Equities segment.
The clearing function of the clearing corporation is designed to work out a) what counter parties owe and b) what
counter parties are due to receive on the settlement date. Settlement is a two way process which involves legal
transfer of title to funds and securities or other assets on the settlement date.
NSCCL has also devised mechanism to handle various exceptional situations like security shortages, bad delivery,
company objections, auction settlement etc.
NSCCL has empanelled 8 clearing banks to provide banking services to trading members and has established
connectivity with both the depositories for electronic settlement of securities.
### Clearing
Clearing is the process of determination of obligations, after which the obligations are discharged by settlement.
NSCCL has two categories of clearing members: trading members and custodians. The trading members can
pass on its obligation to the custodians if the custodian confirms the same to NSCCL. All the trades whose
obligation the trading member proposes to pass on to the custodian are forwarded to the custodian by NSCCL
for their confirmation. The custodian is required to confirm these trade on T + 1 days basis.
Once, the above activities are completed, NSCCL starts its function of Clearing. It uses the concept of multi-
lateral netting for determining the obligations of counter parties. Accordingly, a clearing member would have
either pay-in or pay-out obligations for funds and securities separately. Thus, members pay-in and pay-out
obligations for funds and securities are determined latest by T + 1 day and are forwarded to them so that they
can settle their obligations on the settlement day (T+2). Cleared and non-cleared deals
NSCCL carries out the clearing and settlement of trades executed in the following sub-segments of the Equities segment:
## 1. All trades executed in the Book entry/Rolling segment.
## 2. All trades executed in the Limited Physical Market segment.
NSCCL does not undertake clearing and settlement of deals executed in the Trade for Trade sub-segment of the
Equities (Capital Market) segment of the Exchange. Primary responsibility of settling these deals rests directly
with the members and the Exchange only monitors the settlement. The parties are required to report settlement of these deals to the Exchange. Trading in Retail Debt Segment
Trading in the Retail Debt Market takes place in the same manner in which the trading takes place in the equities
```
(Capital Market) segment. The RETDEBT Market facility on the NEAT system of Capital Market Segment is
```
used for entering transactions in RDM session.
Members eligible for trading in RDM segment
Trading Members who are registered members of NSE in the Capital Market segment and Wholesale Debt
Market segment are allowed to trade in Retail Debt Market (RDM) subject to fulfilling the capital adequacy norms.
Trading Members with membership in Wholesale Debt Market segment only, can participate in RDM on submission of a letter in the prescribed format

## Page 119

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 95
### Trading System
Trading in RDM also take place on the 'National Exchange for Automated Trading' (NEAT) system, a
fully automated screen based trading system, which adopts the principle of an order driven market. The
RETDEBT Market facility on the NEAT system of Capital Market Segment is used for entering transactions in RDM session.
The securities available in this segment will not available in F & O and inquiry terminal.
### Trading Cycle
Trading in Retail Debt Market is permitted under Rolling Settlement, where in each trading day is considered as
a trading period and trades executed during the day are settled based on the net obligations for the day.
Settlement is on a T+2 basis i.e. on the 2nd working day. For arriving at the settlement day all intervening
holidays, which include bank holidays, NSE holidays, Saturdays and Sundays are excluded. Typically trades
taking place on Monday are settled on Wednesday, Tuesday's trades settled on Thursday and so on.
### Settlement
Primary responsibility of settling trades concluded in the WDM segment rests directly with the participants and
the Exchange monitors the settlement. Mostly these trades are settled in Mumbai. Trades are settled gross, i.e.
on trade for trade basis directly between the constituents/participants to the trade and not through any Clearing
House mechanism. Thus, each transaction is settled individually and netting of transactions is not allowed.
Settlement is on a rolling basis, i.e. there is no account period settlement. Each order has a unique settlement
date specified upfront at the time of order entry and used as a matching parameter. It is mandatory for trades to
be settled on the predefined settlement date. The Exchange currently allows settlement periods ranging from
same day (T+0) settlement to a maximum of (T+2).
On the scheduled settlement date, the Exchange provides data/information to the respective member/participant
regarding trades to be settled on that day with details like security, counter party and consideration.
The participants through their Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) account (a book entry settlement system) settle
government securities including treasury bills with RBI or through exchange of physical certificates. Other
instruments are settled through delivery of physical securities.
Where trade is settled through the SGL account, exchange of securities and funds is done on DVP basis. Where
trade is settled through delivery of certificates, the consideration is paid through cheque, payorder, Banker's cheque or RBI cheque.
The required settlement details, i.e. certificate no., SGL form no., Cheque no., constituent etc. are reported by the member/participant to the Exchange.
The Exchange closely monitors the settlement of transactions through the reporting of settlement details by
members and participants. In case of deferment of settlement or cancellation of trade, participants are required
to seek prior approval from the Exchange. For any dispute arising in respect of the trades or settlement, the
exchange has established arbitration mechanism for resolving the same.
# STRAIGHT THROUGH PROCESSING
The global securities market is passing through an interesting phase. Driven by globalization of the securities
market, technology innovations and increasing trade volumes, the financial industry is moving towards Straight Through Processing.
Straight Through Processing (STP) is generally understood to be a mechanism that automates the end to end
processing of transactions of financial instruments. It involves use of a system to process or control all elements

## Page 120

96 EP-CM&SL
of the work flow of a financial transaction, what are commonly known as the Front, Middle, Back office and
General Ledger. In other words, STP allows electronic capturing and processing of transactions in one pass
from the point of order origination to final settlement.
STP thus streamlines the process of trade execution and settlement and avoids manual entry and re-entry of the
details of the same trade by different market intermediaries and participants. Usage of STP enables orders to be
processed, confirmed, settled in a shorter time period and in a more cost effective manner with fewer errors.
Advantages of Straight Through Processing
Advantages of Straight through Processing as under: – Reduced risk
– Automation of manual process minimizing errors
– Improved operational efficiency in handling larger volumes
– Facilitates movement towards shorter settlement cycles (T+1) – Lower cost per trade
– Timely settlement of trades and instructions
– Eliminates paper work and minimizes manual intervention
– Enables increased cross border trading (FII trades)
– Greater transparency with clear audit trail
– Increases competitive advantage of our markets
– Messaging standards as per ISO 15022 standards
Straight Through Processing (STP) thus aims to bring in non-duplication of work, efficiency and automation of
the manual procedures right from trade initiation to settlement processes.
SEBI had mandated the use of Straight Through Processing (STP) system for all institutional trades w.e.f. July,
## 2004. In order to regulate the STP service it had also issued SEBI (STP Centralised Hub and STP Service
Providers) Guidelines, 2004 (STP Guidelines) which also prescribes the model agreement between the STP
centralised hub and the STP service providers.
STP guidelines prescribes the eligibility criteria and conditions of approval for the STP centralised hub and the
STP service providers, obligations and responsibilities of the STP centralised hub and the STP service providers
and code of conduct for the STP service providers. The STP centralised hub and the STP service providers are
required to abide by these Guidelines. To prescribe contractual obligations between the STP centralised hub
and the STP service providers and to facilitate standardisation of service, a model agreement between the STP
centralised hub and the STP service providers has also been prescribed by SEBI as Schedule II to the Guidelines.
The agreement between the STP centralised hub and the STP service provider includes the provisions included in the model agreement. DIRECT MARKET ACCESS (DMA)
Direct Market Access (DMA) is a facility which allows brokers to offer clients direct access to the exchange
trading system through the broker’s infrastructure without manual intervention by the broker. Some of the
advantages offered by DMA are direct control of clients over orders, faster execution of client orders, reduced
risk of errors associated with manual order entry, greater transparency, increased liquidity, lower impact costs
for large orders, better audit trails and better use of hedging and arbitrage opportunities through the use of
decision support tools / algorithms for trading.

## Page 121

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 97

# DEMUTUALIZATION OF STOCK EXCHANGES
The process of demutualization is to convert the traditional “not for-profit” stock exchanges into a “for profit”
company and this process is to transform the legal structure from a mutual form to a business corporation form.
SEBI had set up a committee under the Chairmanship of Justice Kania for the same which came up with report
on demutualization of Stock Exchanges through uniform scheme prescribed. Accordingly, SEBI issued scheme
of demutualization to BSE and other Regional Stock Exchanges.
The important features of the demutualisation exercise are as follows :
```
(1) The board of a stock exchange should consist of 75% public interest/ shareholder directors and only 25% broker directors, and
```
```
(2) 51% shareholding of the stock exchange should be divested to public/ investors other than trading
```
member brokers and only 49% of shareholding can remain with the trading member brokers. This will
transform our broker-owned stock exchanges into professionally-run corporate stock exchanges.
The options prescribed for divestment/dilution of brokers’ shareholding in a stock exchange are as follows:

## Page 123

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 99
```
(1) Offer for sale, by issue of prospectus, of shares held by trading member brokers.
```
```
(2) Private placement of shares (either of the shares held by the member brokers or new shares by the
```
exchange) to any person or group of persons subject to the prior approval of SEBI and the maximum
limit of 5% to any single person/group of persons.
```
(3) Fresh issue of shares to the public through an IPO.
```
The purpose of demutualisation is as follows:
## 1. Stock exchanges owned by members tend to work towards the interest of members alone, which could
on occasion be detrimental to rights of other stakeholders. Division of ownership between members and
outsiders can lead to a balanced approach, remove conflicts of interest, create greater management accountability.
## 2. Publicly owned stock exchanges can enter into capital market for expansion of business.
## 3. Publicly owned stock exchange would be more professionally managed than broker owned.
## 4. Demutualisation enhances the flexibility of management.
SMALLAND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE (SME) EXCHANGE
SME exchange means a trading platform of a recognised stock exchange having nationwide trading terminals
permitted by SEBI to list the specified securities issued in accordance with SEBI (ICDR) Regulation and includes
a stock exchange granted recognition for this purpose but does not include the Main Board.
Here Main Board means a recognized stock exchange having nationwide trading terminals, other than SME exchange.
The two stock exchange of India i.e. Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) have
begun their SME listing platforms. While BSE SME Exchange began its operation in March, 2012, NSE's SME
exchange titled EMERGE commenced operations in September, 2012. Benefits of Listing onSME Exchange
– Access to capital and future financing opportunities
– Going public would provide the MSME's with equity financing opportunities to grow their business - from
expansion of operations to acquisitions.
– Companies in the growth phase tend to get over-leveraged at which point, banks are reluctant to provide
further credit. Equity capital is then necessary to bring back strength to the balance sheet. The option of
equity financing through the equity market allows the firm to not only raise long-term capital but also get
further credit due through an additional equity infusion. The issuance of public shares expands the
investor base, and this in turn will help set the stage for secondary equity financings, including private placements.
– In addition, Issuers often receive more favourable lending terms when borrowing from financial institutions.
The mechanics of listing on a stock exchange (audited balance sheets, being subject to corporate
governance norms etc) would address many of the transparency and informational asymmetry constraints
that the financial institutions face in lending to the SME sector. In addition, equity financing lowers the
debt burden leading to lower financing costs and healthier balance sheets for the firms. The continuing
requirement for adhering to the stock market rules for the issuers lower the on-going information and monitoring costs for the banks.

## Page 124

100 EP-CM&SL – Increased visibility and prestige
Going public is likely to enhance the company's visibility. Greater public awareness gained through
media coverage, publicly filed documents and coverage of stock by sector investment analysts can
provide the SME with greater profile and credibility. This can result in a more diversified group of investors,
which may increase the demand for that company's shares leading to an increase in the company's value. – Venture Capital (VC)
It has been seen that there is greater vitality of venture capital in stock market centered systems. The
underdeveloped equity culture has made it difficult for companies to both get into the VC phase as well
as graduate from venture capital/startups phase to a scale of operations that would make them
internationally competitive. A vibrant equity market would provide prove to be an added incentive for
greater venture capital participation by providing an exit option leading to a reduction in their lock-in period. – Liquidity for shareholders
Becoming a public company establishes a market for the company's shares, providing its investors with
an efficient and regulated vehicle in which to trade their own shares. Greater liquidity in the public
market can lead to better valuation for shares than would be seen through private transactions. – Create employee incentive mechanisms
The employees of the SME enterprises can participate in the ownership of their own company and
benefit from being a shareholder. This can serve to ensure stronger employee commitment to the
company's performance and success. Share options in a public company have an immediate and tangible
value to employees, especially as a recruitment incentive.
– Facilitate growth through Mergers and Acquisitions
As a public company, company's shares can be utilized as an acquisition currency to acquire target
companies, instead of a direct cash offering. Using shares for an acquisition can be a tax efficient and
cost effective vehicle to finance such a transaction.
– Encourages Innovation & Entrepreneurial Spirit
The ability of companies in their early stages of development to raise funds in the capital markets allows
these companies to grow very quickly. This growth helps speed up the dissemination of new technologies
throughout the economy. In addition, by raising the returns available from pursuing new ideas,
technologies etc the capital markets facilitate entrepreneurial activities. – Efficient Risk Distribution
The development of the capital markets has helped distribute risk more efficiently by transfer of risk to
those best able to bear it. This ability to transfer risk facilitates greater risk- taking, but this increased
risk-taking does not destabilize the economy. Thus the capital markets ensure that capital flows to its
best uses and that riskier activity with higher payoffs are funded. Institutional Trading Platform (ITP)
SEBI has notified new norms for listing of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) including the start-up companies
on Institutional Trading Platform (ITP) on stock exchanges without an initial public offering. This will allow SMEs
to list themselves on stock exchanges without raising funds from the public, which in turn will help both the investor and the small companies.

## Page 125

Lesson 4 Market Infrastructure Institutions – Stock Exchange Trading Mechanism 101
In the modified rules to permit listing of start-ups and SMEs in ITP without having to make an IPO, a minimum
amount for trading or investment on the ITP would be Rs. 10 lakh. This move will provide easier exit options for
entities such as Angel Investors, Venture Capital Funds and Private Equities. Besides, the move would provide
better visibility, wider investor base and greater fund raising capabilities to such companies. SEBI notified that
the company would not make an IPO while its specified securities are listed on ITP, but can raise capital through
private placement or rights issue without an option for renunciation of rights. An SME will be eligible to list on the
ITP, in case the company, its promoter, director, Group Company does not appear in the defaulters list of Reserve
Bank and there is no winding up petition against the firm.
Dedicated Debt Segment on Stock Exchanges
SEBI vide circular dated January 24, 2013 prescribed guidelines for providing dedicated debt segment on stock
exchanges. Further, SEBI vide circular dated September 12, 2013 prescribed the Risk Management Framework
for Dedicated Debt Segment on Stock Exchanges. The debt segment shall offer separate trading, clearing,
settlement, reporting facilities and membership to deal in :
```
(i) “debt securities” as defined in Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008;
```
```
(ii) Government Securities, Treasury Bills, State Government loans, SLR and Non-SLR Bonds issued by
```
Financial Institutions, municipal bonds, single bond repos, basket repos and CBLO kind of products

# INTRODUCTION
Debt markets are markets for the issuance, trading and settlement of various types and features of fixed income
securities. Fixed income securities can be issued by any legal entity like central and state governments, public
bodies, statutory corporations, banks and institutions and corporate bodies.
The debt market in India comprises mainly of two segments viz., the Government securities market consisting of
Central and State Governments securities, Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs), Floating Rate Bonds (FRBs), T-Bills
and the corporate securities market consisting of FI bonds, PSU bonds, and Debentures/Corporate bonds.
Government securities form the major part of the market in terms of outstanding issues, market capitalization and trading value.
The trading of government securities on the Stock exchanges is currently through Negotiated Dealing System
using members of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) / National Stock Exchange (NSE) and these trades are
required to be reported to the exchange. The bulk of the corporate bonds, being privately placed, were, however,
not listed on the stock exchanges. Two Depositories, National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central
Depository Services (India) Limited (CDSL) maintain records of holding of securities in a dematerialized form.
Records of holding of government securities for wholesale dealers like banks/Primary Dealers (PDs) and other
financial institutions are maintained by the RBI.
Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) is an electronic platform for facilitating dealing in Government Securities
and Money Market Instruments. NDS facilitates electronic submission of bids/application by members for
primary issuance of Government Securities by RBI through auction and floatation. It will provide an interface to the Securities Settlement System.
# DEBT MARKET INSTRUMENTS
# CORPORATE DEBENTURE
It is a debt security issued by a company, which offers to pay interest in lieu of the money borrowed for a certain
period. In essence it represents a loan taken by the issuer who pays an agreed rate of interest during the lifetime
of the instrument and repays the principal normally, unless otherwise agreed, on maturity.
These are long-term debt instruments issued by private sector companies, in denominations as low as ` 1000
and have maturities ranging between one and ten years. Debentures enable investors to reap the dual benefits
of adequate security and good returns. Unlike other fixed income instruments such as Fixed Deposits, Bank
Deposits, Debentures can be transferred from one party to another.
Debentures can be divided into different categories on the basis of convertibility of the instrument and Security.
The debentures issued on the basis of Security includes – – Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) – Partly Convertible Debentures (PCDs) – Fully convertible Debentures (FCDs)
– Optionally Convertible Debentures (OCDs) – Secured Debentures – Unsecured Debentures

# FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS
Deposit It serve as medium of saving and as a means of payment and a bank basically has
three types of deposits, i.e. time deposit, savings deposit and current account.
Fixed Deposit Fixed Deposits are sums accepted by most of the NBFCs and banks for certain point of
time. However, the interest rate offered by NBFC is regulated by RBI. The deposits
offered by NBFCs are not insured whereas the deposits accepted by most banks are
insured up to a maximum of Rs.1, 00,000.
# INTEREST BASED BONDS
Coupon Bonds Coupon Bonds pays periodic interest at the pre-determined rate of interest. The annual
rate at which the interest is paid is known as the coupon rate or simply the coupon. The
dates on which the interest payments are made, are known as the coupon due
dates. Interest is usually paid half-yearly though in some cases it may be monthly,
quarterly, annually or at some other periodicity
Zero Coupon A zero coupon bond does not carry any coupon and are issued at a discount to its face
Bonds value. Gain to the investor is difference between the issue price and the face value of bonds.
# DERIVED INSTRUMENTS
These instruments are not direct debt instruments. Instead they derive value from various debt instruments. The following are the derived instruments:
Mortgage Bonds Mortgage backed bonds is a collateralized term-debt offering. Every issue of such bonds
is backed by a pledged collateral. These bonds are like the bonds floated in the capital
market, semi-annual or quarterly payments of interest and final bullet payment of principal.
Pass through When mortgages are pooled together and undivided interest in the pool are sold. It
Certificates promises that the cash flow from the underlying mortgages would be passed through to
the holders of the securities in the form of monthly payments of interest and principal.
Participation These are strictly inter-bank instruments confined to the scheduled commercial banks
Certificates and its tenure does not exceeding 90 days. Interests rate on such certificate are
determined by the two contracting banks.
# BENCHMARKED INSTRUMENTS
An Instrument in which the payment of interest is based on some benchmark index is known as benchmark
instruments. The following are the benchmarked instruments:
Floating Interest Interest rate is not fixed and periodically the interest rate payable for the next period is
Rate set with reference benchmarked Index such as LIBOR, MIBOR, etc.
Inflation Linked In these bonds, payments are indexed by reference to the change in the value of a
Bonds general price or wage index over the term of the instrument. The options are that either
the interest payments are adjusted for inflation or the principal repayment or both.

# INVESTORS IN DEBT MARKET
Investors are the entities who invest in fixed income instruments. The investors in such instruments are generally
Banks, Financial Institutions, Mutual Funds, Insurance Companies, Provident Funds etc. The individual investors
invest to a great extent in Fixed Income products.
### Banks
Collectively all the banks put together are the largest investors in the debt market. They invest in all instruments
ranging from T-Bills, CPs and CDs to GOISECs, private sector debentures etc. Banks lend to corporate sector
directly by way of loans and advances and also invest in debentures issued by the private corporate sector and in PSU bonds.
### Insurance Companies
The second largest category of investors in the debt market are the insurance companies.
### Provident Funds
Provident funds are estimated to be the third largest investors in the debt market. Investment guidelines for
provident funds are being progressively liberalized and investment in private sector debentures is one step in this direction.
Most of the provident funds are very safety oriented and tend to give much more weightage to investment in
government securities although they have been considerable investors in PSU bonds as well as state government backed issues.
### Mutual Funds
Mutual funds represent an extremely important category of investors. World over, they have almost surpassed
banks as the largest direct collector of primary savings from retail investors. Mutual funds include the Unit Trust
of India, the mutual funds set up by nationalized banks and insurance companies as well as the private sector
mutual funds set up by corporates and overseas mutual fund companies.
### Trusts
Trusts include religious and charitable trusts as well as statutory trusts formed by the government and quasi
government bodies. There are very few instruments in which trusts are allowed to invest. Most of the trusts
invest in CDs of banks and bonds of financial institutions and units of Unit Trust of India.
### Corporate Treasuries
Corporate Treasuries have become prominent investors only in the last few years. Treasuries could be either
those of the public sector units or private sector companies or any other government bodies or agencies. The
treasuries of PSUs as well as the governmental bodies are allowed to invest in papers issued by DFIs and
banks as well as GOISECs of various maturities. However the orientation of the investments is mostly in short-
term instruments or sometimes in extremely liquid long term instruments which can be sold immediately in the markets.
In complete contrast to public sector treasuries, those in the private sector invest in CDs of banks and CPs of
other private sector companies, GOISECs as well as debentures of other private sector companies. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs)
India does not allow capital account convertibility either to overseas investors or to domestic residents. Registered
FPIs are exception to this rule. FPIs have to be specifically and separately approved by SEBI for equity and

## Page 133

Lesson 5 Debt Market 109
debt. Each FPIs is allocated a limit every year up to which it can invest in Indian debt securities. They are also
free to disinvest any of their holdings, at any point of time, without prior permission.
### Retail Investors
Since January 2002, retail investors have been permitted to submit non-competitive bids at primary auction
through any bank or Primary Dealers (PDs). DEBT MARKET INTERMEDIARIES/PARTICIPANTS
### Primary Dealers
Primary dealers (PDs) are important intermediaries in the government securities markets. They act as underwriters
in the primary market, and as market makers in the secondary market. PDs underwrite a portion of the issue of
government security that is floated for a pre­determined amount. The underwriting commitment of each PD is
broadly decided on the basis of its size in terms of its net owned funds, its holding strength, the committed
amount of bids and the volume of turnover in securities.
### Brokers
Brokers play an important role in secondary debt market by bringing together counterparties and negotiating
terms of the trade. It is through them that the trades are entered on the stock exchanges. The brokers are
regulated by the stock exchanges and also by SEBI. DEBT MARKET – REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
In India, a well developed banquet of laws such RBI Act, Law of Contract, Securities Contracts (Regulation)
```
(SCRA) Act, Government Securities (GS) Act, Payment and Settlement Systems Act, Depositories Act, etc.
```
define the legal framework for debt markets. The RBI Act has made it incumbent upon RBI to manage the public
debt and also on Government to entrust public debt management to RBI. SCRA Act governs all the Contracts
```
(transactions) in securities including Government Securities. The GS Act applied to Government Securities
```
created and issued by the Central Government. Role ofRBI
The Reserve Bank of India manages the public debt and issues new loans on behalf of the Union and the State
Governments under the powers derived from the Reserve Bank of India Act. It also undertakes cash and liquidity
management for the Government of India and State Governments and administers the scheme of Ways and Means Advances (WMA).
Internal Debt Management Department of the RBI manages internal debt. This involves auctioning the Government
debt from time to time, introduction of new instruments, smoothening the maturity structure of debt, placing of
debt at market related rates and improving depth and liquidity of Government securities by developing active
secondary market for them. The Government Securities Act, 2006 governs the Government Debt Market.
The Reserve Bank of India is, therefore, the main regulator for the Money Market. RBI is responsible for the
market for repo/reverse repo transactions in Corporate debt. Issuance of Non-convertible Debentures Reserve
Bank Directions, 2010 is also applicable for issuance of NCDs of original or initial maturity upto 1 year. Apart
from its role as a regulator, it has to simultaneously fulfill several other important objectives viz. managing the
borrowing program of the Government of India, controlling inflation, ensuring adequate credit at reasonable
costs to various sectors of the economy, managing the foreign exchange reserves of the country and ensuring a stable currency environment.
RBI controls the interest rate policy. Earlier, it used to strictly control interest rates through a directed system of
interest rates. Each type of lending activity was supposed to be carried out at a pre-specified interest rate. Over
the years RBI has moved slowly towards a regime of market determined controls. RBI provides negotiated

dealing system which is an electronic platform for facilitating dealing in Government Securities and money market instruments. Role ofSEBI
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) controls corporate debt market in cases where entities raise
money from public through public issues.
It regulates the manner in which such money are raised and ensure a fair play for the retail investor. The issuers
are required to make the retail investor aware, of the risks inherent in the investment, by way of disclosure.
Being regulator for the Mutual Funds in India SEBI regulates the entry of new mutual funds in the industry and
also the instruments in which mutual funds can invest.
### Other Regulator
Apart from the two main regulators, the RBI and SEBI, there are several other regulators specific for different
classes of investors. The Central Provident Fund Commissioner and the Ministry of Labour regulate the Provident
Funds. Religious and Charitable trusts are regulated by some of the State governments of the states, in which these trusts are located.

```
(a) If the interest payment date falls on a holiday, the payment may be made on the following working day
```
however the dates of the future coupon payments would be as per the schedule originally stipulated at the time

## Page 144

120 EP-CM&SL
of issuing the security. In other words, the subsequent coupon schedule would not be disturbed merely because
the payment date in respect of one particular coupon payment has been postponed earlier because of it having fallen on a holiday. For example:
Date of Issue of Corporate bonds: July 01, 2016 Date of Maturity: June 30, 2018
Date of coupon payments: January 01 and July 01 Coupon payable: semi-annually
In this case, January 01, 2017 is a Sunday, thus the coupon would be payable on January 02, 2017 i.e. the next
working day. However the calculation for payment of interest will be only till December 31, 2016, which would
have been the case if January 01, 2017 were not a holiday. Also, the next dates of payment would remain July
01, 2017 and January 01, 2018 despite the fact that one of the interest payment was made on January 02, 2017.
```
(b) In order to ensure consistency for interest calculation, a uniform methodology shall be followed for calculation
```
of interest payments in the case of leap year, which shall be as follows:
In case of a leap year, if February 29 falls during the tenor of a security, then the number of days shall be
reckoned as 366 days (Actual/Actual day count convention) for a whole one year period, irrespective of whether
the interest is payable annually, half yearly, quarterly or monthly etc. It is thus emphasized that for a half yearly
interest payment, 366 days would be reckoned twice as the denominator; for quarterly interest, four times and
for monthly interest payment, twelve times.
```
(c) In order to ensure uniformity for payment of interest/redemption with respect to debt securities, interest/
```
redemption payments shall be made only on the days when the money market is functioning in Mumbai.

# MUNICIPAL BONDS
The Bangalore Municipal Corporation was the first municipal civil corporattion in the country to issue a municipal
bonds with a state guarantee in 1997. The debt market in India for municipal securities has grown considerably
since the issuance of Municipal bonds in the country without State Government Guarantee by Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation in 1998 for financing infrastructure projects in the city. Since 1998, other cities that have accessed the
capital markets through municipal bonds without state government guarantee include Nashik, Nagpur, Ludhiana,
and Madurai. In most cases, bond proceeds have been used to fund water and sewerage schemes or road
projects. The last issuance was done by Greater Vishakhapatnam Municipal Corporation for Rs 30 Crores in 2010.
The Government of India, in order to boost the municipal bond market, allowed the municipalities to issuer tax-
free municipal bonds. The central government amended the Income Tax Act (1961 vide the Finance Act 2000),
whereby interest income from bonds issued by local authorities was exempted from income tax. The GOI issued
guidelines for issue of tax-free municipal bonds in February 2001. These guidelines stipulate eligible issuers,
use of funds, essential pre-conditions, maturing period, buy-back, nature of issue and tax benefits, ceiling amount
for a project, compulsory credit rating, and external monitoring of the tax-free municipal bond.
Taking into consideration the above, SEBI placed on its website a concept paper, proposing a framework,
governing issuance and listing of debt securities by the Municipalities, along with the draft SEBI (Issue and
Listing of Debt Securities by Municipality) Regulations, 2015 for seeking public comments on the same.
After receiving representations and suggestions SEBI approved the draft Regulations on its Board Meeting
dated 22 March, 2015 and notified the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities by Municipality) Regulations,
2015 on July 15, 2015. These regulations discusses the eligibility requirement for public issue, listing of debt
securities requirement for both public issues and private placement, conditions for continuous and trading of
debt securities, obligations of intermediaries and issuer provisions. These regulations are in line with the
Government of India guidelines for issue of tax-free bonds by Municipalities.
SEBI (ISSUEAND LISTING OF DEBT SECURITIES BY MUNICIPALITIES) REGULATIONS, 2015 These regulations shall apply to –
```

# INTRODUCTION
Money market is a very important segment of a financial system. Monetary assets of short-term nature up to one
year and financial assets that are close substitutes for money are dealt in the money market. Money market
instruments have the characteristics of liquidity (quick conversion into money), minimum transaction cost and
no loss in value. Excess funds are deployed in the money market, which in turn is availed of to meet temporary
shortages of cash and other obligations. Money market provides access to providers and users of short-term
funds to fulfill their investments and borrowings requirements respectively at an efficient market clearing price.
It performs the crucial role of providing an equilibrating mechanism to even out short-term liquidity, surpluses
and deficits and in the process, facilitates the conduct of monetary policy. The money market is one of the
primary mechanism through which the Central Bank influences liquidity and the general level of interest rates in
an economy. The Bank’s interventions to influence liquidity serve as a signaling-device for other segments of the financial system.
The money market functions as a wholesale debt market for low-risk, highly liquid, short term instruments.
Funds are available in this market for periods ranging from a single day upto a year. Mostly government, banks
and financial institutions dominate this market. It is a formal financial market that deals with short-term fund management.
Though there are a few types of players in money market, the role and the level of participation by each type of player differs largely.
Government is an active player in the money market and in most of the economies; it constitutes the biggest
borrower in this market. Both, Government securities (G-secs) and Treasury bill (T-bill) is a security issued by
RBI on behalf of the Government of India to meet the latter’s borrowing for financing fiscal deficit. Apart from
functioning as a banker to the government, the Central Bank (RBI) also regulates the money market and issues
guidelines to govern the money market operations.
Another dominant player in the money market is the banking industry. Banks mobilize deposits of savers in
lending to investors of the economy. This process is known as credit creation. However, banks are not allowed
to lent out the entire amount for extending credit for investment. In order to promote certain prudential norms for
healthy banking practices, most of the developed economies require all commercial banks to maintain minimum
liquid and cash reserves in form of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) framed under
the policies of Central Banks. The banks are required to ensure that these reserve requirements are met before
directing deposits on their credit plans. If banks fall short of these statutory reserve requirements, the deficit
amount can be raised using the money market.
Other institutional players like financial institutions, corporates, mutual funds (MFs), Foreign institutional investors
```
(FIIs) etc. also transact in money market to fulfill their respective short term finance deficits and short falls.
```
However, the degree of participation of these players depends largely on the regulations formulated by the
regulating authorities in an economy. For instance, the level of participation of the FIIs in the Indian money
market is restricted to investment in government securities only.
# FEATURES OF MONEY MARKET
The money market is a wholesale market where the volumes of transactions is very large and is settled on a
daily basis. Trading in the money market is conducted over the telephone, followed by written confirmation
through e-mails, texts from the borrowers and lenders.
There are a large number of participants in the money market: commercial banks, mutual funds, investment
institutions, financial institutions and finally the Reserve Bank of India. The bank's operations ensure that the
liquidity and short-term interest rates are maintained at levels consistent with the objective of maintaining price

Lesson 6 Money Market 155
and exchange rate stability. The Central Bank occupies a strategic position in the money market. The money
market can obtain funds from the central bank either by borrowing or through sale of securities. The bank
influences liquidity and interest rates by open market operations, REPO transactions changes in Bank Rate,
Cash Reserve Requirements and by regulating access to its accommodation. A well-developed money market
contributes to an effective implementation of the monetary policy. It provides:
## 1. A balancing mechanism for short-term surpluses and deficiencies.
## 2. A focal point of Central Bank intervention for influencing liquidity in the economy, and
## 3. A reasonable access to the users of short-term funds to meet their requirements at realistic/reasonable price or cost. MONEY MARKET Vs. CAPITAL MARKET
The money market possesses different operational features as compared to capital market. Money market is
distinguished from capital market on the basis of the maturity period, credit instruments and the institutions: Point of Money Market Capital Market

# GROWTH OF MONEY MARKET
Post reforms period in India has witnessed tremendous growth of the Indian money markets. Banks and other
financial institutions have been able to meet the high expectations of short term funding of important sectors
like the industry, services and agriculture. Functioning under the regulation and control of the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI), the Indian money markets have also exhibited the required maturity and resilience over the years.
The organization and structure of the money market has undergone a sea change in the last decade in India.
This was accompanied by a growth in quantitative terms also.
Up to 1987, the money market consist of 6 facts :
| Point of
Distinction | Money Market | Capital Market |
| --- | --- | --- |

## 1. Call Money Market;
## 2. Inter Bank Term Deposit/Loan Market;
## 3. Participation Certificate Market;
## 4. Commercial Bills Market;
## 5. Treasury Bills Market; and
## 6. Inter-corporate Market. The market had 3 main deficiencies:
## 1. It had a very narrow base with RBI, Banks, LIC and UTI as the only participants lending funds while the borrowers were large in number;
## 2. There were only few money market instruments.
## 3. The interest rates were not market determined but were controlled either by RBI or by a voluntary
agreement between the participants through the Indian Banks Association (IBA).
To set right these deficiencies, the recommendations of Chakravarthy Committee (1985) and the Vaghul Committee
```
(1987) laid foundation for systematic development of the Indian Money Market. The implementation of the
```
suggestions of the respective committees has widened and deepened the market considerably by increasing
the number of participants and instruments and introducing market determined rates as against the existing
administered or volunteered interest rates.
Further, an active secondary market for dealings of money market instrument was created which positively
impacted the liquidity of these instruments. For this purpose, the Discount and Finance House of India Limited
```
(DFHI) was formed as an autonomous financial intermediary in April, 1988 to embellish the short-term liquidity
```
imbalances and to develop an active secondary market for the trading of instruments of the money market. The
DFHI plays the role of a market maker in money market instruments. With the relaxation of the regulatory
framework and the arrival of new instruments and participants, DFHI occupies a key role in ushering a more active and de-regulated money market.

# M O N E Y M A R K E T
The Indian Money Market consists of two types of segments: an organized segment and an unorganized segment.
In the unorganized segment, interest rates are much higher than that in the organized segment.
The organized segment consists of the Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India with its associate Banks,
Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Commercial Banks including Foreign Banks, Regional Rural Banks, Non-
Scheduled Commercial Banks, apart from Non-banking Financial Intermediaries such as LIC, GIC etc.

## Page 181

Lesson 6 Money Market 157
The unorganized segment essentially consists of indigenous bankers, money lenders and other non-bank financial
intermediaries such as Chit Funds. For these institutions there is no clear cut demarcation between short-term
and long-term and between a genuine trade bill and mere financial accommodation. The share of the unorganized
sector in providing trade finance has greatly diminished after the Nationalization of Bank and expansion thereof
into the length and breadth of the country.

# MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS
# TREASURY BILLS
Treasury Bills are money market instruments issued by RBI to finance the short term requirements of the
Government of India. These are discounted securities and thus are issued at a discount to face value. The
return to the investor is the difference between the maturity value and issue price.
In the short term category of investment instruments, the treasury bill carry the lowest risk. RBI issues these at a prefixed date and of a fixed amount.
Treasury Bills are very useful instruments to deploy short term surpluses depending upon the availability and
requirement. Even funds which are kept in current accounts can be deployed in treasury bills to maximise
returns. Banks do not pay any interest on fixed deposits of less than 15 days, or balances maintained in current
accounts, whereas treasury bills can be purchased for any number of days depending on the requirements. This
helps in deployment of idle funds for very short periods as well. Further, since every week there is a 91 days
treasury bills maturing and every fortnight a 364 days treasury bills maturing, one can purchase treasury bills of
different maturities as per requirements so as to match with the respective outflow of funds. At times when the
liquidity in the economy is tight, the returns on treasury bills are much higher as compared to bank deposits even
for longer term. Besides, better yields and availability for very short tenors, another important advantage of
treasury bills over bank deposits is that the surplus cash can be invested depending upon the staggered requirements.
### Example
Suppose party A has a surplus cash of` 200 crore to be deployed in a project. However, it does not require the
funds at one go but requires them at different points of time as detailed below:
Funds Available as on 1.1.2017 ` 200 crore Deployment in a project ` 200 crore As per the requirements 06.1.2017 ` 50 crore 13.1.2017 ` 20 crore

## Page 182

158 EP-CM&SL 02.2.2017 ` 30 crore 08.2.2017 ` 100 crore
Out of the above funds and the requirement schedule, the party has following two options for effective cash management of funds: Option I
Invest the cash not required within 15 days in bank deposits
The party can invest a total of` 130 crore only, since the balance` 70 crores is required within the first 15 days.
Assuming a rate of return of 6% paid on bank deposits for a period of 31 to 45 days, the interest earned by the
company works out to ` 76 lacs approximately. Option II
Invest in Treasury Bills of various maturities depending on the funds requirements
The party can invest the entire ` 200 crore in treasury bills as treasury bills of even less than 15 days maturity
are also available. The return to the party by this deal works out to around ` 125 lacs, assuming returns on
Treasury Bills in the range of 8% to 9% for the above periods.
There are four types of treasury bills : (a) 14-days T bill
The Maturity is in 14 days. Its auction is on every Friday of every week. The notified amount for this auction is` 100 crores. (b) 91-days T bill
The Maturity is in 91 days. Its auction is on every Friday of every week. The notified amount for this auction is` 100 crores. (c) 182-days T bill
The Maturity is in 182 days. Its auction is on every alternate Wednesday (which is not a reporting week). The
notified amount for this auction is` 100 crores. (d) 364-days T bill
The Maturity is in 364 days. Its auction is on every alternate Wednesday (which is a reporting week). The
notified amount for this auction is` 500 crores.
A considerable part of the government's borrowings is financed through T-bills of various maturities. Based on
the bids received at the auctions, RBI decides the cut off yield and accepts all bids below this yield.
The usual investors in these instruments are banks who invest not only to invest their short-term surpluses but
also to get benefitted for maintaining the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirements in T-bills is reckoned for
the purpose of statutory reserves. FIIs so far have not been allowed to invest in this instrument.
These T-bills which are issued at a discount can be traded in the market. Most of the time, unless the investor
requests specifically, these are issued not as securities but as entries in the Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL)
which is maintained by RBI. The transactions cost on T-bill are non-existent and trading is considerably high in
each bill, immediately after its issue and immediately before its redemption.
The yield on T-bills is dependent on the rates prevalent on other investment avenues open for investors. For
instance, low yield on T-bills as a result of high liquidity in banking system due to by low call rates, would divert
the funds from T-bills market to other markets. This would particularly be so, if banks already hold the minimum
stipulated amount of SLR in government instrument.

(b) Zero default risk being sovereign paper
```
```
(c) Highly liquid money market instrument
```
```
(d) Better returns especially in the short term (e) Transparency (f) Simplified settlement
```
```
(g) High degree of tradeability and active secondary market facilitates meeting unplanned fund requirements.
```
FEATURES OF TREASURY BILLS (a) Form
The treasury bills are issued in the form of promissory note in physical form or by credit to Subsidiary General
Ledger (SGL) account or Gilt account in dematerialized form. (b) Minimum Amount of Bids
Bids for treasury bills are to be made for a minimum amount of ` 25000/- only and in multiples thereof. (c) Eligibility
All entities registered in India like banks, financial institutions, Primary Dealers, firms, companies, corporate
bodies, partnership firms, institutions, mutual funds, Foreign Institutional Investors, State Governments, Provident
Funds, trusts, research organisations, Nepal Rashtra bank and even individuals are eligible to bid and purchase Treasury bills. (d) Repayment
The treasury bills are repaid at par on the expiry of their tenure at the office of the Reserve Bank of India. (e) Availability
All the treasury bills are highly liquid instruments available both in the primary and secondary market. (f) Day Count
For treasury bills the day count is taken as 365 days for a year. (g) Yield Calculation
The yield of a Treasury Bill is calculated as per the following formula: (100 – P) X 365 X 100 Y =
P X D Wherein Y = Discounted yield P = Price D = Days to maturity
### Example
A cooperative bank wishes to buy 91 days Treasury Bill on Oct. 12, 2014 which is maturing on Dec. 6, 2014. The
rate quoted by seller is ` 99.1489 per ` 100 face values. The YTM can be calculated as following:

## Page 184

160 EP-CM&SL
The days to maturity of Treasury bill are 55 (October – 20 days, November – 30 days and December – 5 days)
```
YTM = (100-99.1489) x 365 x 100/(99.1489*55) = 5.70%
```
Similarly if the YTM is quoted by the seller, price can be calculated by putting the price in above formula.
### Primary Market
In the primary market, treasury bills are issued by auction technique.
Salient Features of the Auction Technique:
```
(a) The auction of treasury bills is done only at Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.
```
```
(b) Bids are to be submitted on Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) by 2:30 PM on Wednesday. If Wednesday
```
happens to be a holiday then bids are to be submitted on previous day (Tuesday).
```
(c) Bids are submitted in terms of price per` 100. For example, a bid for 91-days Treasury bill auction could
```
be for` 97.50 for per unit of T-bill of face valuer of ` 100.
```
(d) Auction committee of Reserve Bank of India decides the cut-off price and results are announced on the same day.
```
```
(e) Bids above the cut-off price receive full allotment; bids at cut-off price may receive full or partial allotment
```
and bids below the cut-off price are rejected.
### Secondary Market
The participants can also trade T-bills held from primary market in the secondary market established for the
purpose. The major advantages of dealing in treasury bill secondary market are: Market related yields, ideal
matching for funds management particularly for short-term tenors of less than 15 days, Transparency in operations
as the transactions would be put through Reserve Bank of India’s SGL or Client’s Gilt account only, two way
quotes offered by primary dealers for purchase and sale of treasury bills and certainty in terms of availability, entry and exit.
# TYPES OF AUCTION
There are two types of auction for treasury bills:
– Multiple Price Based or French Auction: Under this method, all bids equal to or above the cut-off
price are accepted. However, the bidder has to obtain the treasury bills at the price quoted by him. This
method is followed in the case of 364 days treasury bills and is valid only for competitive bidders.
– Uniform Price Based or Dutch Auction: Under this system, all the bids equal to or above the cut-off
price are accepted at the cut- off level. However, unlike the Multiple Price based method, the bidder
obtains the treasury bills at the cut-off price and not the price quoted by him. This method is applicable
in the case of 91 days treasury bills only. The system of Dutch auction has been done away with by the
RBI w.e.f 08.12.2002 for the 91 days Treasury Bill. What is Dutch auction?
When all the bids accepted at the cut off level it is known as Dutch Auction. What is French Auction?
When all the bids accepted are equal to or above the cut off price it is known as French Auction.

# CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSITS
Certificate of Deposits (CDs) is a negotiable money market instrument and issued in dematerialised form or as
Usance Promissory Note, against funds deposited at a bank or other eligible financial institution for a specified
time period. Guidelines for issue of CDs are presently governed by various directives issued by the Reserve
Bank of India, as amended from time to time.
ELIGIBILITY CDs can be issued by:
```
(i) scheduled commercial banks excluding Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Local Area Banks (LABs); and
```
```
(ii) selected all-India Financial Institutions that have been permitted by RBI to raise short-term resources within the umbrella limit fixed by RBI.
```
# AGGREGATE AMOUNT
The amount of CDs allowed to be issued by:
```
(i) Banks: varying according to the requirements keeping in limits the CRR and SLR requirements as stipulated by RBI.
```
```
(ii) Financial Institutions:may issue CDs within the overall umbrella limit fixed by RBI. As per the prevailing
```
guidelines issued by RBI, an FI can issue CDs together with other instruments viz., term money, term
deposits, commercial papers and inter corporate deposits, not exceeding 100 per cent of its net owned
funds, as per the latest audited balance sheet.
# MINIMUM SIZE OF ISSUE AND DENOMINATIONS
Minimum amount of a CD should be `1 lakh i.e., the minimum deposit that could be accepted from a single
subscriber should not be less than `1 lakh and in the multiples of ` 1 lakh thereafter. CDs can be issued to
individuals, corporations, companies, trusts, funds, associations, etc. Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) may also
subscribe to CDs, but only on non-repatriable basis which should be clearly stated in the Certificate. Such CDs
cannot be endorsed to another NRI in the secondary market.
# MATURITY
The maturity period of CDs issued by banks should not be less than 7 days and not more than one year from the date
of issue. The FIs can issue CDs for a period not less than 1 year and not exceeding 3 years from the date of issue. DISCOUNT/COUPON RATE
CDs may be issued at a discount on face value. Banks/FIs are allowed to issue CDs on the basis of floating rate
provided the methodology of compiling the floating rate is objective transparent and market based. The issuing
bank/FI is free to determine the discount/coupon rate. The interest rate on floating rate CDs would have to be reset
periodically in accordance with a pre-determined formula that indicates the spread over a transparent benchmark.
# RESERVE REQUIREMENTS
Banks have to maintain the appropriate reserve requirements, i.e., cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory
liquidity ratio (SLR), on the issue price of the CDs.
# TRANSFERABILITY
– Physical CDs are freely transferable by endorsement and delivery.
– Demat CDs can be transferred as per the procedure applicable to other demat securities.
– There is no lock-in period for the CDs.

## Page 186

162 EP-CM&SL
– Banks/FIs cannot grant loans against CDs.
– Furthermore, they cannot buy-back their own CDs before maturity. TRADES IN CDs
All OTC trades in CDs shall be reported within 15 minutes of the trade on the reporting platform Clearcorp Dealing Systems (India) Ltd. (CDSIL). FORMAT OF CDs
Banks/FIs should issue CDs only in the dematerialised form. However, according to the Depositories Act, 1996,
investors have the option to seek certificate in physical form. Accordingly, if the investor insists on physical
certificate, the bank/FI may inform to Chief General Manager, Financial Markets Regulation Departement, Reserve
Bank of India about such instances separately. Further,issuance of CD will attract stamp duty. There will be
no grace period for repayment of CDs. If the maturity date happens to be holiday, the issuing bank should make
payment on the immediate preceding working day. Banks/FIs may, therefore, so fix the period of deposit that the
maturity date does not coincide with a holiday to avoid loss of discount / interest rate.
# SECURITY ASPECT
Since physical CDs are freely transferable by endorsement and delivery, it will be necessary for banks to see
that the certificates are printed on good quality security paper and necessary precautions are taken to guard
against tempering with the document. They should be signed by two or more authorized signatories.
# PAYMENT OF CERTIFICATE
Since CDs are transferable, the physical certificate may be presented for payment by the last holder. The
question of liability on account of any defect in the chain of endorsements may arise. It is, therefore, desirable
that banks take necessary precautions and make payment only by a crossed cheque. Those who deal in these
CDs may also be suitably cautioned. The holders of dematted CDs will approach their respective depository
participants (DPs) and have to give transfer/delivery instructions to transfer the demat security represented by
the specific ISIN to the ‘CD Redemption Account’ maintained by the issuer. The holder should also communicate
to the issuer by a letter/fax enclosing the copy of the delivery instruction it had given to its DP and intimate the
place at which the payment is requested to facilitate prompt payment. Upon receipt of the demat credit of CDs in
the “CD Redemption Account”, the issuer, on maturity date, would arrange to repay to holder/transferor by way
of Banker’s cheque/high value cheque, etc.
# ISSUE OF DUPLICATE CERTIFICATES
In case of the loss of physical CD certificates, duplicate certificates can be issued after compliance of the following conditions:
```
(a) A notice is required to be given in at least one local newspaper;
```
```
(b) Lapse of a reasonable period (say 15 days) from the date of the notice in the newspaper; and
```
```
(c) Execution of an indemnity bond by the investor to the satisfaction of the issuer of CDs.
```
The duplicate certificate should only be issued in physical form. No fresh stamping is required as a duplicate
certificate is issued against the original lost CD. The duplicate CD should clearly state that the CD is a Duplicate
one stating the original value date, due date, and the date of issue (as “Duplicate issued on______”).
# ACCOUNTING
Banks/FIs may account the issue price under the Head “CDs issued” and show it under deposits. Accounting
entries towards discount will be made as in the case of “cash certificates”. Banks/FIs should maintain a register
of CDs issued with complete particulars.

## Page 187

Lesson 6 Money Market 163 INTER-CORPORATE DEPOSITS
Apart from CDs, corporates also have access to another market called the Inter Corporate Deposits (ICD)
market. An ICD is an unsecured loan extended by one corporate to another. Existing mainly as a refuge for low
rated corporates, this market allows corporates with surplus funds to lend to other corporates facing shortage of
funds. Another aspect of this market is that the better-rated corporates can borrow from the banking system and
lend in this market to make speculative profits. As the cost of funds for a corporate in much higher than that of a
bank, thus, the rates in this market are higher than those in the other markets. ICDs are unsecured, and hence
the risk inherent is high. The ICD market is an unorganised market with very less information available publicly about transaction details.
# COMMERCIAL BILLS
Commercial bills are basically negotiable instruments accepted by buyers for goods or services obtained by
them on credit. Such bills being bills of exchange can be kept upto the due maturity date and encashed by the
seller or may be endorsed to a third party in payment of dues owing to the latter. The most common practice is
that the seller who gets the accepted bills of exchange discounts it with the Bank or financial institution or a bill
discounting house and collects the money (less the interest charged for the discounting).
The volume of bills both inland and foreign, which are discounted accounted, forms a substantial part of the total
scheduled commercial bank credit. Over the years this is coming down. The Reserve Bank has been attempting
to develop a market for commercial bills. The bill market scheme was introduced in 1942 and a new scheme
called Bill Rediscount Scheme with several new features was introduced in November, 1970. Under the latter
scheme the RBI rediscount bills at the bank rates or at rates specified by it at its discretion. Since the rediscounting
facility has been made restrictive, it is generally available on a discretionary basis.
The difficulties which stand in the way of bill market development are, the incidence of stamp duty, shortage of
stamp paper, reluctance of buyers to accept bills, predominance of cash credit system of lending and the
administrative work involved in handling documents of title to goods. To be freely negotiable and marketable, the
bills should be first class bills i.e. those accepted by companies having good reputation. Alternatively, the bills
accepted by companies should be co-accepted by banks as a kind of guarantee. In the absence of these
criteria, bill market has not developed in India as the volume of first class bills is very small.
# COMMERCIAL PAPER
Commercial Paper (CP) is an unsecured money market instrument issued in the form of a promissory note. CP, as
a privately placed instrument, was introduced in India in 1990 with a view to enable highly rated corporate borrowers
to diversify their sources of short-term borrowings and to provide an additional instrument to investors. Subsequently,
primary dealers (PDs), and all-India financial institutions were also permitted to issue CP to enable them to meet
their short-term funding requirements for their operations. The Guidelines for issue of CP are presently governed
by various directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India, as amended from time to time.
The guidelines for issue of CP are given below: Eligible issuers of CP
Companies, PDs and financial institutions (FIs) are permitted to raise short-term resources under the umbrella
limit fixed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are eligible to issue CP.
A company would be eligible to issue CP provided:
```
(a) the tangible net worth of the company, as per the latest audited balance sheet, is not less than ` 4 crore;
```
```
(b) the company has been sanctioned working capital limit by bank/s or FIs; and
```

## Page 188

164 EP-CM&SL
```
(c) the borrowal account of the company is classified as a Standard Asset by the financing bank/ institution.
```
### Rating Requirements
All eligible participants shall obtain credit rating for issuance of CP from any one of the SEBI registered Credit Rating Agencies.
The minimum credit rating shall be ‘A3’ [as per rating symbol and definition prescribed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)].
### Maturity
CP can be issued for maturities between a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of up to one year from the date of
issue. The maturity date of the CP should not go beyond the date up to which the credit rating of the issuer is valid.
### Denominations
CP can be issued in denominations of` 5 lakh and multiples thereof. The amount invested by a single investor
should not be less than` 5 lakh (face value). Limits and the Amount of Issue of CP
The aggregate amount of CP from an issuer shall be within the limit as approved by its Board of Directors or the
quantum indicated by the CRA for the specified rating, whichever is lower. Banks and FIs will, however, have the
flexibility to fix working capital limits, duly taking into account the resource pattern of company’s financing, including CPs.
An FI can issue CP shall be within the overall umbrella limit prescribed in the Master Circular on Resource
Raising Norms for FIs, issued by Reserve Bank of India, Department of Banking Regulation as prescribed and updated from time-to-time.
The total amount of CP proposed to be issued should be raised within a period of two weeks from the date on
which the issuer opens the issue for subscription. Issuing and Paying Agent (IPA)
Only a scheduled bank can act as an IPA for issuance of CP. Investment in CP
CP may be issued to individuals, banking companies, other corporate bodies (registered or incorporated
in India) and unincorporated bodies, Non-Resident Indians and Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs).
However, investment by FIIs would be within the limits set for them by SEBI and compliance with the provisions of
the FEMA 1999, the Foreign Exchange (Deposit) Regulations, 2000 and Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer
or Issue of Security by a Person Resident Outside India) Regulations, 2000, as amended from time to time. Trading in CP
All OTC trades in CP shall be reported within 15 minutes of the trade to the reporting platform of Clearcorp Dealing Systems (India) Ltd. (CDSIL) Mode of Issuance
CP can be issued either in the form of a promissory note and held in physical form or in a dematerialised form
through any of the depositories approved by and registered with SEBI. Provided all RBI regulated entities can
deal in and hold CP only in dematerialised form through such depositories. CP will be issued at a discount to

## Page 189

Lesson 6 Money Market 165
face value as may be determined by the issuer. No issuer shall have the issue of CP underwritten or co- accepted. Preference for Dematerialisation
While option is available to both issuers and subscribers to issue/hold CP in dematerialised or physical form,
issuers and subscribers are encouraged to opt for dematerialised form of issue/holding. However, banks, FIs
and PDs are required to make fresh investments and hold CP only in dematerialised form. Payment of CP
The initial investor in CP shall pay the discounted value of the CP by means of a crossed account payee
cheque to the account of the issuer through IPA. On maturity of CP, when CP is held in physical form, the
holder of CP shall present the instrument for payment to the issuer through the IPA. However, when CP is held
in demat form, the holder of CP will have to get it redeemed through the depository and receive payment from the IPA. Procedure for Issuance
Every issuer must appoint an IPA for issuance of CP. The issuer should disclose to the potential investors, its
financial position as per the standard market practice. After the exchange of deal confirmation between the
investor and the issuer, issuing company shall issue physical certificates to the investor or arrange for crediting
the CP to the investor’s account with a depository. Investors shall be given a copy of IPA certificate to the effect
that the issuer has a valid agreement with the IPA and documents are in order. Role and Responsibilities
The role and responsibilities of issuer, IPA and CRA are set out below: (a) Issuer
With the simplification in the procedures for issuance of CP, issuers would now have greater flexibility.
However, they have to ensure that the guidelines and procedures laid down for CP issuance are strictly adhered to. (b) Issuing and Paying Agent (IPA)
```
(i) The IPA would ensure that the issuer has the minimum credit rating as stipulated by RBI and the amount
```
mobilised through issuance of CP is within the quantum indicated by CRA for the specified rating or as
approved by its Board of Directors, whichever is lower.
```
(ii) The IPA has to verify all the documents submitted by the issuer, viz., copy of board resolution,
```
signatures of authorised executants (when CP is issued in physical form) and issue a certificate to this effect.
```
(iii) Certified copies of original documents, verified by the IPA, should be held in the custody of IPA.
```
```
(iv) All scheduled banks, acting as the IPAs should submit the data pertaining to CP issuances on the
```
Online Returns Filing System (ORFS) module of the RBI within two days from the date of issuance of CP.
```
(v) The IPA shall certify that it has a valid agreement with the issuer. (c) CRA
```
```
(i) The CRA shall be abide by the Code of Conduct prescribed by the SEBI for CRAs for undertaking rating
```
of capital market instruments shall be applicable to CRAs for rating CPs.
```
(ii) The CRAs would henceforth have the discretion to determine the validity period of the rating depending
```

## Page 190

166 EP-CM&SL
upon its perception about the strength of the issuer. Accordingly, they shall, at the time of rating, clearly
indicate the date when the rating is due for review.
```
(iii) The CRAs would have to closely monitor the rating assigned to issuers vis-à-vis their track record at
```
regular intervals and would be required to make their revision in the ratings public through their publications and website
# FACTORING
Factoring is a financial transaction where an entity sells its receivables to a third party called a ‘factor’, at
discounted prices. Factoring is a financial option for the management of receivables. In simple definition it is the
conversion of credit sales into cash. In factoring, a financial institution (factor) buys the accounts receivable of a
company (Client) and pays up to 80%(rarely up to 90%) of the amount immediately on formation of agreement.
Factoring company pays the remaining amount (Balance 20%-finance cost-operating cost) to the client when
the customer pays the debt. Collection of debt from the customer is done either by the factor or the client
depending upon the type of factoring. The account receivable in factoring can either be for a product or service.
```
Examples : factoring against goods purchased, factoring for construction services (usually for government
```
contracts where the government body is capable of paying back the debt in the stipulated period of factoring.
Contractors submit invoices to get cash instantly), factoring against medical insurance etc.
# PARTIES IN FACTORING
The factoring transaction involves three parties:
– The Seller, who has produced the goods/services and raised the invoice.
– The Buyer, the consumer of goods/services and the party to pay.
– The Factor, the financial institution that advances the portion of funds to the seller.
# FACTORING PROCESS
The steps involved in factoring are listed below:
– The seller interacts with the funding specialist/broker and explains the funding needs.
– The broker prepares a preliminary client profile form and submits to the appropriate funder for consideration.
– Once both parties agree that factoring is possible, the broker puts the seller in direct contact with the
funder to ask/answer any additional questions and to negotiate a customized factoring agreement,
which will meet the needs of all concerned.
– At this point, the seller may be asked to remit a fee with formal application to cover the legal research
costs, which will be incurred during "due diligence". This is the process by which the buyer’s credit
worthiness is evaluated through background checks, using national database services.
– During the next several days, the funder completes the "due diligence" process on the seller, further
verifies invoices and acknowledges any liens, UCC filings, judgments or other recorded encumbrances on the seller’s accounts receivables.
– The seller is advised of the facility and is asked to advise the buyers of the Factor by letter and submit
an acknowledged copy of the same to the Factor for records.
– A detailed sanction letter is given to the seller and their acceptance on the same taken, with the required
signatories. (Authorized signatories would be mentioned in the “Signing Authorities” section of the Proposal presented by seller).

## Page 191

Lesson 6 Money Market 167
– Sanction terms must contain the following.
- All facilities covered under the sanction.
- The period for which the sanction is valid
- When the facility comes into effect e.g. (if facility is dated 1/12/13, it can state that invoices raised
from or after 15/12/13 only would be Factored).
- Who the authorized signatories are for signing invoices for factoring. • The limits.
- The seller has to advise the buyer of the Factoring agreement.
- Copy of such advice acknowledged by the buyer should be submitted to the Factor. Buyer’s consent
is not required to decide on the Factor. – The discounting rates, charges fixed.
– In case of discounts given by the seller to the buyer, which value would be financed by the factor (since
the factored amount should never exceed the amount actually payable by buyer).
– Usually within 7 to 10 days of the initial contact with the factor, agreements are signed, customers are
notified, UCC forms filed and the first advance is forwarded to the company. This advance can vary
between 70 - 80% of the face value of the invoices being factored. In the construction industry, the
advances may be in the range of 60 - 70%. The remaining amount is called the "reserve" which is held
by the factor until the invoices are paid. The factor then deducts his fee and returns the remaining funds to the seller.
– The seller performs services or delivers products, thus creating an invoice.
– The seller sends or faxes a copy of the invoice directly to the factor.
– The funder verifies the invoice and the advance is sent to the seller as per the agreement with the factor.
In certain cases, the funder wires the funds to the seller’s account for an additional fee.
– The buyer pays the factor. The factor then returns any remaining reserve, minus the fee, which has
been predetermined in the negotiated agreement.
# ADVANTAGES FOR THE SELLER
– Seller gets funds immediately after the sale is effected and on presentation of accepted sales invoices and Promissory notes.
– Major part of paper work and correspondence is taken care of by the factor.
– Follow-up, for recovery of funds, is done mainly by the factor.
– Interest rates are not as high as normal discounting. – Increased cash flow to meet payroll. – Immediate funding arrangements.
– No additional debt is incurred on balance sheet. – Other assets are not encumbered.
– Approval is not based on seller’s credit rating.

# TYPES OF FACTORING
### Factoring
### Full Recourse Maturity Advance Undisclosed Invoice
Factoring Factoring Factoring Factoring Factoring Discounting Non-Recourse or Full factoring
Under this type of factoring the bank takes all the risk and bear all the loss in case of debts becoming bad debts.
### Recourse Factoring
Under this type of factoring the bank purchases the receivables on the condition that any loss arising out or bad
debts will be borne by the company which has taken factoring.
### Maturity Factoring
Under this type of factoring bank does not give any advance to the company rather bank collects it from customers
and pays to the company either on the date of collection from the customers or on a guaranteed payment date.
### Advance Factoring
Under advance factoring arrangement the factor provides an advance against the uncollected and non-due receivables to the firm.

Lesson 6 Money Market 169
### Undisclosed Factoring
Under this type of factoring, the customer is not informed of the factoring arrangement. The firm may collect
dues from the customer on its own or instruct to make remit once at some other address.
### Invoice Discounting
Under this type of factoring the bank provide an advance to the company against the account receivables and in
turn charges interest rate from the company for the payment which bank has given to the company.
# BILLS REDISCOUNTING
Bill redisounting means the rediscounting of trade bills, which have already been purchased by/discounted with
the bank by the customers. These trade bills arise out of supply of goods/services. Bill rediscounting is a money
market instrument where the bank buys the bill (i.e. Bill of Exchange or Promissory Note) before it is due and
credits the value of the bill after a discount charge to the customer’s account. Now, the bank which has discounted
the bill may require getting it ‘rediscounted’ with some other bank to get the fund.
### Features
– The banks normally rediscount the bills that have already been discounted with them or raise usance
promissory notes in convenient lots and maturities and rediscount them.
– Rediscount of bills should be for a minimum period of 15 days and for a maximum period of 90 days.
– Discount is calculated on Actual/365 days basis.
– The amount payable to the borrower is the principal amount less the discount/interest.
– While discounting a bill, the amount of discount is to be deducted at the time the bill is issued.
– The discount is rounded off to the nearest rupee.
– On maturity the borrower would repay the principal amount.

# INTRODUCTION
Mutual fund is a mechanism for pooling the resources by issuing units to the investors and investing funds in
securities in accordance with objectives as disclosed in offer document. Investments in securities are spread
across a wide cross-section of industries and sectors and thus the risk is reduced. Diversification reduces the
risk because all stocks may not move in the same direction in the same proportion at the same time. Mutual fund
issues units to the investors in accordance with quantum of money invested by them. Investors of mutual funds
are known as unitholders. The profits or losses are shared by the investors in proportion to their investments.
The mutual funds normally come out with a number of schemes with different investment objectives which are
launched from time to time. A mutual fund is required to be registered with SEBI before it can collect funds from the public.
The small investors who generally lack expertise to invest on their own in the securities market have reinforced
the saying “Put not your trust in money, put your money in trust’. They prefer some kind of collective investment
vehicle like, MFs, which pool their marginal resources, invest in securities and distribute the returns therefrom
among them on cooperative principles. The investors benefit in terms of reduced risk and higher returns arising
from professional expertise of fund managers employed by the MFs. This approach was conceived in the USA
in the 1930s. In developed financial markets, MFs have almost overtaken bank deposits and total assets of insurance funds.
Experiment with MFs in India began in 1964 with the establishment of Unit Trust of India (UTI). UTI lost its
monopoly status in 1987 with the entry of other public sector MFs promoted by public sector banks and insurance
companies. The industry was opened to private sector, including foreign institutions, in 1993 giving Indian investors
a broader choice and increasing competition to public sector funds.
# AN OVERVIEW OF TRENDS IN MUTUAL FUNDS
As in mature markets, mutual funds in emerging markets have been among the fastest growing institutional
investors. One key difference between mutual funds of mature and emerging markets has been the relative
importance of bond and equity funds are often much larger than those of bond funds, (particularly in Japan, the
United Kingdom, the United States). In contrast, emerging market bond funds in a number of countries have
larger assets under management than do equity funds particularly in Brazil, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. In part,
this reflects the difference in the relative development of the local markets in mature and emerging markets. This
difference reflects a search for higher yield on the part of retail investors. As the nominal interest rates have
declined in many emerging countries since the late 1990s, retail investors have seen an extended decline in the
interest rate of traditional savings instruments. To obtain higher yields, retail investors should subscribe to bond
funds with investment in longer term government and corporate bonds.
Household savings play an important role in domestic capital formation. Only a small part of the household
savings in India is channelised to the capital market. Attracting more households to the capital market requires
efficient intermediation. The mutual funds have emerged as one of the important class of financial intermediaries
which cater to the needs of retail investors. As a traditional investment vehicle, the mutual funds pool resources
from the households and allocate them to various investment opportunities.
# ADVANTAGES OF MUTUAL FUNDS
The advantages of investing in a mutual fund are:
## 1. Professional Management: Investors avail the services of experienced and skilled professionals who
are backed by a dedicated investment research team which analyses the performance and prospects of
companies and selects suitable investments to achieve the objectives of the scheme.

## Page 199

Lesson 7 Mutual Funds 175
## 2. Diversification: Mutual funds invest in a number of companies across a broad cross-section of industries
and sectors.This diversification reduces the risk because seldom do all stocks decline at the same time
and in the same proportion. Investors achieve this diversification through a Mutual Fund with far less money than one can do on his own.
## 3. Convenient Administration: Investing in a mutual fund reduces paper work and helps investors to
avoid many problems such as bad deliveries, delayed payments and unnecessary follow up with brokers
and companies. Mutual funds save investors time and make investing easy and convenient.
## 4. Return Potential: Over a medium to long term, Mutual funds have the potential to provide a higher
return as they invest in a diversified basket of selected securities.
## 5. Low Costs: Mutual funds are a relatively less expensive way to invest compared to directly investing in
the capital markets because the benefits of scale in brokerage, custodial and other fees translate into lower costs for investors.
## 6. Liquidity: In open ended schemes, investors can get their money back promptly at net asset value
related prices from the mutual fund itself. With close ended schemes, investors can sell their units on a
stock exchange at the prevailing market price or avail of the facility of direct repurchase at net asset
value (NAV) related prices which some close ended and interval schemes offer periodically or offer it for
redemption to the fund on the date of maturity.
## 7. Transparency: Investors get regular information on the value of their investment in addition to disclosure
on the specific investments made by scheme, the proportion invested in each class of assets and the
fund manager’s investment strategy and outlook.
# SCHEMES ACCORDING TO MATURITY PERIOD
The MFs in India offer a wide array of schemes that cater to different needs suitable to any age, financial
position, risk tolerance and return expectations. These include: open-ended schemes, which provide easy
liquidity; close-ended schemes with a stipulated maturity period; growth schemes, which provide capital
appreciation over medium to long term; income schemes, which provide regular and steady income to investors;
balanced schemes, which provide both growth and income by periodically distributing a part of income and
capital gains they earn; money market schemes; which provide easy liquidity, preservation of capital and
moderate income; and tax saving schemes, which offer tax rebates to investors under tax laws as prescribed from time to time.
```
(i)Open ended mutual funds: An open ended mutual funds is a fund with a non-fixed number of outstanding
```
shares/units, that stands ready at any time to redeem them on demand. The fund itself buys back the shares
surrendered and is ready to sell new shares. Generally the transaction takes place at the net asset
value which is calculated on a periodical basis. The net asset value (Net Asset Value per share-value of the
fund’s is total net assets after liabilities divided by the total number of shares outstanding on a given day) of
the mutual funds rises or falls as a result of the performance of securities in the portfolio and the stock
exchanges. The key feature of open ended scheme is liquidity.
```
(ii)Close ended mutual funds: It is the fund where mutual fund management sells a limited number of shares
```
and does not stand ready to redeem them.Generally the transaction takes place at the net asset value which is
calculated on a weekly basis. The shares of such mutual funds are traded in the secondary markets. The
requirement for listing is laid down to grant liquidity to the investors who have invested with the mutual fund.
Therefore, close ended funds are more like equity shares. The main differences between close ended and open ended funds are :

## 4. Mostly liquid. 4. Highly Liquid.
# SCHEMES ACCORDING TO INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
Besides these, there are other types of mutual funds also to meet the investment needs of several groups of
investors. Some of them include the following:
```
(a) Income Oriented Schemes: The fund primarily offer fixed income to investors. Naturally enough, the
```
main securities in which investments are made by such funds are the fixed income yielding ones like
bonds, corporate debentures, Government securities and money market instruments, etc.
```
(b) Growth Oriented Schemes: These funds offer growth potentialities associated with investment in
```
capital market namely: (i) high source of income by way of dividend and (ii) rapid capital appreciation,
both from holding of good quality scrips. These funds, with a view to satisfying the growth needs of
investors, primarily concentrate on the low risk and high yielding spectrum of equity scrips of the corporate sector.
```
(c) Hybrid Schemes: These funds cater to both the investment needs of the prospective investors - namely
```
fixed income as well as growth orientation. Therefore, investment targets of these mutual funds are
judicious mix of both the fixed income securities like bonds and debentures and also sound equity
scrips. In fact, these funds utilise the concept of balanced investment management. These funds are, thus, also known as “balanced funds”.
```
(d) High Growth Schemes: As the nomenclature depicts, these funds primarily invest in high risk and
```
high return volatile securities in the market and induce the investors with a high degree of capital appreciation.
```
(e) Capital Protection Oriented Scheme: It is a scheme which protects the capial invested in the mutual
```
fund through suitable orientation of is portfolio structure.
```
(f) Tax Saving Schemes: These schemes offer tax rebates to the investors under tax laws as prescribed
```
from time to time. This is made possible because the Government offers tax incentive for investment in
specified avenues. For example, Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) and pensions schemes.
```
(g) Special Schemes: This category includes index schemes that attempt to replicate the performance of
```
particular index such as the BSE, Sensex or the NSE-50 or industry specific schemes (which invest in
specific industries) or sectoral schemes (which invest exclusively in segment such as ‘A’ Group or initial
public offering). Index fund schemes are ideal for investors who are satisfied with a return approximately
equal to that of an index. Sectoral fund schemes are ideal for investors who have already decided to invest in particular sector or segment.
```
(h) Real Estate Funds: These are close ended mutual funds which invest predominantly in real estate and properties.
```
```
(i) Off-shore Funds: Such funds invest in securities of foreign companies with RBI permission.
```

(j) Leverage Funds: Such funds, also known as borrowed funds, increase the size and value of portfolio
```
and offer benefits to members from out of the excess of gains over cost of borrowed funds. They tend to
indulge in speculative trading and risky investments.

(k) Hedge Funds: They employ their funds for speculative trading, i.e. for buying shares whose prices are
```
likely to rise and for selling shares whose prices are likely to fall.
```
(l) Fund of Funds: They invest only in units of other mutual funds. Such funds do not operate at present in India.
```
```
(m) New Direction Funds: They invest in companies engaged in scientific and technological research
```
such as birth control, anti-pollution, oceanography etc.
```
(n) Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs) are a new variety of mutual funds that first introduced in 1993. ETFs
```
are sometimes described as mere “tax efficient” than traditional equity mutual funds, since in recent
years, some large ETFs have made smaller distribution of realized and taxable capital gains than most mutual funds.
```
(o) Money Market Mutual Funds: These funds invest in short- term debt securities in the money market
```
like certificates of deposits, commercial papers, government treasury bills etc. Owing to their large size,
the funds normally get a higher yield on such short term investments than an individual investor.

# INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
Bottom up Investing: This is an investment strategy which considers the fundamental factors driving individual
stock performance before considering the economic prospectus which affect the industry and within which the company operates.
Top down Investing: This is an investment strategy which first takes a view on the economy and then looks
at the industry scenario to assess the potential performance of a company. This is opposite to Bottom up Technique.
Equity funds are considered aggressive in so far as higher capitalisation is sought. Investors should have a
long term orientation, since companies shares give fluctuating dividends and offer benefits only in the long run through rights issue, bonus issue etc.
Balanced funds are considered moderate since investors seek growth and stability but with moderate risk.
Such funds invest both in bonds and blue chip shares. While bonds give stable interest income, the share
dividends will be fluctuated though in the long run, they may give larger benefits. The exact balance between the
two asset classes namely - shares and bonds depends on the fund managers ability to take risk and his priority
for return. The normal ratio between stocks and bonds is 55:45 but if the fund manager is aggressive he could choose a larger equity component.
Income funds are regarded as conservative since investors want regular income and can not wait for more than short to medium term.
Money market funds are regarded as high liquidity oriented as investors attach more value for safety and liquidity.
Sector funds invest only in shares of companies belonging to a specific industry. These funds perform well so
long as the industry or the sector is in the upswing, but the risk could be high, if the industry or the sector goes down.

# OFFER DOCUMENT OF MUTUAL FUND SCHEMES
The Offer Document shall have two parts i.e. Scheme Information Document (SID) and Statement of Additional
Information (SAI). SID shall incorporate all information pertaining to a particular scheme. SAI shall incorporate
all statutory information on Mutual Fund. The Mutual Funds shall prepare SID and SAI in the prescribed formats.
Contents of SID and SAI shall follow the same sequence as prescribed in the format. The Board of the AMC and
the Trustee(s) shall exercise necessary due diligence, ensuring that the SID/SAI and the fees paid are in conformity
with the Mutual Funds Regulations. All offer documents (ODs) of Mutual Fund schemes shall be filed with SEBI

# ADDITIONAL MODE OF PAYMENT THROUGH APPLICATIONS SUPPORTED BY BLOCKED
# AMOUNT IN MUTUAL FUNDS
ASBA facility which investors have been enjoying for subscription to public issue of equity capital of companies
has been extended to the investors subscribing to New Fund Offers (NFOs) of mutual fund schemes. It shall co-
exist with the current process, wherein cheques/ demand drafts are used as a mode of payment. The banks
which are in SEBI’s list shall extend the same facility in case of NFOs of mutual fund schemes to all eligible
investors in Mutual Fund units. Mutual Funds shall ensure that adequate arrangements are made by Registrar
and Transfer Agents for the implementation of ASBA. Mutual Funds/AMCs shall make all relevant disclosures in
this regard in the SAI.The Mutual Funds/AMCs have to compulsorily provide ASBA facility to the investors for all the NFOs launched by them.
# RISKS INVOLVED IN MUTUAL FUNDS
Mutual funds may face the following risks, leading to non-satisfactory performance:
## 1. Excessive diversification of portfolio, losing focus on the securities of the key segments.
## 2. Too much concentration on blue-chip securities which are high priced and which do not offer more than average return.
## 3. Necessity to effect high turnover through liquidation of portfolio resulting in large payments of brokerage and commission.
## 4. Poor planning of investment with minimum returns.
## 5. Unresearched forecast on income, profits and Government policies.
## 6. Fund managers being unaccountable for poor results.
## 7. Failure to identify clearly the risk of the scheme as distinct from risk of the market. CALCULATION OF NET ASSET VALUE (NAV)
Mutual funds raise money by selling their shares to public and redeeming them at current net asset value. Net
asset value is the value of the assets of each unit of the scheme. Thus if the NAV is the more than the face
value of ` 10/-, there is an appreciation for the investment. If the NAV is less than the face value, it indicates
depreciation of the investment. NAV also includes dividends, interest accruals and reduction of liabilities and
expenses apart from market value of investments. Every mutual fund shall compute the NAV of each scheme
by dividing the net asset of the scheme by the number of units of that scheme outstanding on the date of

## Page 203

Lesson 7 Mutual Funds 179
valuation and public the same at least in two daily newspapers at intervals not exceeding one week. However,
the net asset value of any scheme for special target segment or any monthly scheme which are not mandatorily
required to be listed in the stock exchange may publish the NAV at monthly or quarterly intervals as permitted by SEBI.
# MUTUAL FUND COSTS
There are two broad categories of mutual fund costs, namely - (a) Operating expenses (b) Sales charges. These terms are explained below:
```
(a) Operating Expenses: Costs incurred in operating mutual funds include advisory fees paid to investment
```
managers, custodial fees, audit fees, transfer agent fees, trustee fees, agents commission etc. The
break-up of these expenses is required to be reported in the schemes offer document.
```
(b) Sales Charges: These are otherwise called as sales loads and are charged directly to the investors.
```
Mutual funds use the sales loads for payment of agents commission and expenses for distribution and marketing.
There is no entry load for all mutual fund schemes. The scheme application forms carry a suitable disclosure to
the effect that the upfront commission to distributors will be paid by the investor directly to the distributor, based
on his assessment of various factors including the service rendered by the distributor. Of the exit load or Contingent
Deferred Sales charges (CDSC) charged to the investor, a maximum of 1% of the redemption proceeds is
required to be maintained in a separate account which can be used by the AMC to pay commissions to the
distributor and to take care of other marketing and selling expenses. Any balance shall be credited to the
scheme immediately. CDSC is a structured back end load paid when the units are redeemed during the initial of
ownership. The distributors should disclose all the commissions (in the form of trail commission or any other
mode) payable to them for the different competing schemes of various mutual funds from amongst which the
scheme is being recommended to the investor. AMC(s) shal not charge entry/or exit load on bonus units and
units allottd on reinvestment of dividend.
# TRANSACTION CHARGES
- A transaction charges means trading expenses charged to the investor when buying or selling units of
mutual funds or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). A transaction charges per subscription of Rs.10, 000/
- and above be allowed to be paid to the distributors of the Mutual Fund products. However, there shall
be no transaction charges on direct investments.
- The transaction charge in case of existing investors in a Mutual Fund, the distributor may be paid
Rs.100/- as transaction charge per subscription of Rs.10,000/- and above. There shall be no transaction
charge on subscription below Rs.10,000/- and in case of new investors, the distributor may be paid
Rs.150/- as transaction charge for a first time investor in Mutual Funds.
- The transaction charges, if any, shall be deducted by the AMC from the subscription amount and paid to
the distributor; and the balance shall be invested. In case of Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), the
transaction charge shall be applicable only if the total commitment through SIPs amounts to Rs.10,000/-
and above. In such cases the transaction charge shall be recovered in 3-4 instalments.
# ROLL OVER OF A SCHEME
A mutual fund can roll over a close ended scheme on or before the redemption of the scheme after giving an
option to investors to redeem their units at NAV based price. The roll over scheme may include a fresh extension
of period or continue under the same terms of the original scheme with or without modifications.

## Page 204

180 EP-CM&SL
# SWITCH OVER ONE SCHEME TO ANOTHER
A mutual fund may use its discretion to permit switching over of the investment in units from one to another of its
schemes, to help the investor shift, from a high risk scheme to a low risk one or vice-versa.
# ANNUALISED RETURNS
Investors buy and sell mutual fund shares/units during a short period and make profits. Percentage of profits in
such short periods can not be a reliable measure. The proper method is to calculate returns on an annualised
basis at the compounded average rate over a year. ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY (AMC)
Under SEBI Regulations, every mutual fund is required to have an Asset Management Company (AMC)
incorporated in accordance with the Companies Act, 2013 to manage the funds of the mutual fund. The AMC
should be approved by SEBI and should enter into an agreement with the trustees of the mutual fund to formulate
schemes, raise money against units, invest the funds in accrued securities and after meeting the permissible
costs as per norms, distribute income to the share holders of the funds.
# RESTRICTION ON REDEMPTION IN MUTUAL FUNDS
The facility of restriction on redemption under any scheme of the mutual fund can be made only after the
approval from the board of directors of the Asset Management Company (AMC) and the trustees.
Restriction on redemption should apply during excess redemption requests that could arise in overall market
crisis situations rather than exceptional circumstances of entity specific situations.
Therefore, in order to bring more clarity and to protect the interest of the investors, the following requirement
shall be observed before imposing restriction on redemptions:
– Restriction may be imposed when there are circumstances leading to a systemic crisis or event that
severely constricts market liquidity or the efficient functioning of markets such as:
- Liquidity issues - When market at large, becomes illiquid affecting almost all securities instead of
any issuer specific security. AMCs should have in place,a sound internal liquidity management tools
for schemes. Restriction on redemption cannot be used as an ordinary tool in order to manage the liquidity of a scheme.
- Market failures, exchange closures - When markets are affected by unexpected events which
impact the functioning of exchanges or the regular course of transactions. Such unexpected events
could also be related to political, economic, military, monetary or other emergencies.
- Operational issues – When exceptional circumstances are caused by force majeure, unpredictable
operational problems and technical failures (e.g. a black out). Such cases can only be considered if
they are reasonably unpredictable and occur in spite of appropriate diligence of third parties, adequate
and effective disaster recovery procedures and systems.
– Restriction on redemption may be imposed for a specified period of time which is not more than 10 working days in any 90 days period.
– Any imposition of restriction would require specific approval of board of AMCs and trustees and the
same should be informed to SEBI immediately.
– When restriction on redemption is imposed, the following procedure shall be applied:
- No redemption requests upto INR 2 lakh shall be subject to such restriction.

## Page 205

Lesson 7 Mutual Funds 181
- Where redemption requests are above INR 2 lakh, AMCs shall redeem the first INR 2 lakh without
such restriction and remaining part over and above INR 2 lakh shall be subject to such restriction.
The above information to investors shall be disclosed prominently and extensively in the scheme related
documents regarding the possibility that their right to redeem may be restricted in such exceptional circumstances
and the time limit for which it can be restricted. SEBI (MUTUAL FUND) REGULATIONS, 1996

Transaction in excess of permissible limits — A case study
SEBI v. Shriram Mutual Fund & Others - Appeal No. 9523-24 of 2003
```
(a) A penalty of Rs.2 lakh was imposed by Adjudicating Officer (AO) on Shriram Mutual Fund (SMF) as it
```
had repeatedly exceeded the permissible limits of transactions through its associate broker, in terms
of Regulation 25(7) (a) of SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations.
```
(b) On an appeal by SMF, SAT vide its final judgment and order dated August 21, 2003, set aside AO’s
```
order inter-alia on the ground that the limit was not exceeded intentionally.
```
(c) SEBI filed an appeal under Section 15Z of the SEBI Act in the Hon’ble Supreme Court.
```
```
(d) The Hon’ble Supreme Court pronounced its final judgment and order on May 23, 2006. Hon’ble
```
Supreme Court set aside the judgment of SAT and settled the issues, as under:
– Mens rea is not an essential ingredient for contravention of the provisions of a Civil Act.
– Penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act
is established, and therefore the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial.
– Unless the language of the statute indicated the need to establish the element of mens rea, it is
generally sufficient to prove that a default in complying with the statute has occurred.
– Once the contravention is established, the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary.
– The SAT has erroneously relied on the judgment in the case of Hindustan Steel Limited vs. State
of Orissa (AIR 1970 SC 253) as the said case has no application in the present case which
relates to imposition of civil liabilities under SEBI Act and Regulations; and is not a criminal / quasi-criminal proceeding.
– Imputing mens rea into the provisions of Chapter VIA is against the plain language of the statute
and frustrates entire purpose and object of introducing Chapter VIA which was to give teeth to the
SEBI to secure strict compliance of the Act and the Regulations.

# INTRODUCTION
SEBI had earlier framed the SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 (“VCF Regulations”) to encourage
investments into start-ups and mid-size companies. Since the introduction of the VCFRegulations, it was observed
by SEBI that the venture capital route was being used by several other categories of funds such as private
equity funds, real estate funds etc. Further since registration as a venture capital fund(“VCF”) was not mandatory
under the VCF Regulations, not all private equity or other categories of funds were registering with the SEBI.
While these funds did not enjoy certain exemptions that were available to VCFs, they were not subjected to any investment restrictions either.
Currently, while retail investors such as mutual funds and collective investment schemes are well regulated,
SEBI noted the need for comprehensive regulations to deal with investments that are sourced from diverse parts of the private pool of capital.
Accordingly, SEBI notified the Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) Regulations to govern unregulated entities and
create a level playing ground for existing venture capital investors.
The AIF Regulations aim to regulate funds involved in the pooling or raising of private capital from institutional
investors or high net worth investors (“HNI”) with a view to invest such funds in accordance with a defined investment
policy for benefit of the investors and the manager of such fund, irrespective of their legal domicile. These regulations
provide that an entity, seeking to pool and manage such private pool of capital for investing in securities or acting
as an Alternative Investment Fund (“AIF”), should be registered with the SEBI under these regulations.
# EXISTING VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS
Existing VCFs will be permitted to continue and shall be governed by the VCF Regulations till such fund or
scheme managed by the fund is wound up. VCFs will not be permitted to raise any fresh funds after notification
of these regulations, as aforesaid, except for commitments already made by investors as on the date of the
notification. These VCFs may seek re-registration under AIF Regulations, subject to approval of two-thirds of
their investors by value. Existing funds (falling within the definition of an AIF) not registered with SEBI may
continue to operate for 6 months from the date of commencement of the AIF Regulations or if it has already
made an application for registration under these regulations within those 6 months then till the disposal of its
application (extendable up to 12 months in special cases with the permission of SEBI). These funds will not be
allowed to float any new scheme without registration under the AIF Regulations. Schemes floated by such funds
before coming into force of AIF Regulations, shall only be allowed to continue till maturity. Further existing funds
that are currently not registered with SEBI but wish to seek registration under the AIF Regulations may apply to
SEBI for exemption from the strict compliance with the AIF Regulations if they are not able to comply with all provisions of these regulations.
SEBI (ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS) REGULATIONS, 2012
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has notified the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds)
Regulations, 2012 on 21 May, 2012 - a comprehensive regulatory framework for regulating private pools of
capital or Alternative Investment Funds, thus bringing various funds investing in Indian securities under a unified regulatory umbrella.
REPEAL OF THE SEBI (VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS) REGULATIONS, 1996
This Regulation has replaced the existing SEBI (Venture Capital Funds) Regulations, 1996 (“VCF Regulations”).
Funds registered under the VCF Regulations shall continue to be regulated by the said regulations till the existing fund or scheme is wound up.

# INTRODUCTION
A collective investment scheme is a trust based scheme that comprises a pool of assets that is managed by a
collective investment scheme manager and is governed by the Collective Investment Schemes Regulations
given by SEBI. Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) are a popular form of investment, and they are accessible
to all. Each investor has a proportional stake in the CIS portfolio based on how much money he or she contributed.
The word ‘unit’ refers to the portion or part of the CIS portfolio that is owned by the investor. The ‘trust’ is the
financial instrument that is created in order to manage the investment. The trust enables financial experts to
invest the money on behalf of the CIS investor. Collective Investment Schemes provide a relatively secure
means of investing on the Stock Exchange, and other financial instruments. The sum of money that are exchanged
on the Stock Exchange and in the Money Markets make them too pricey for most people. With a CIS, the money
or funds from a group of investors are pooled or collected together to form a CIS portfolio.
In order to strengthen the hands of SEBI to protect interests of investors in plantation companies, the Securities
Laws (Amendment) Act, 1999 amended the definition of ’securities’ in the SC(R) Act, so as to include within its
ambit the units or any other instruments issued by any CIS to the investors in such schemes. The Act also
inserted a definition of the CIS in the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.
The International Organisation of Securities Commission (IOSCO) in its Report on Investment Management of
the Technical Committee defined a Collective Investment Scheme (CIS) as an open ended collective investment
scheme that issues redeemable units and invests primarily in transferable securities or money market instruments.
According to SEBI Act, 1992, ‘Collective Investment Scheme’ means any scheme or arrangement which satisfies
the conditions specifies in section 11AA.
Section 11AA provides that any scheme or arrangement which satisfies the conditions referred to in sub-section
```
(2) or sub-section (2A) shall be a collective investment scheme.
```
However, any pooling of funds under any scheme or arrangement, which is not registered with SEBI or is not
covered under sub-section (3), involving a corpus amount of one hundred crore rupees or more shall be deemed to be a collective investment scheme.
Sub-section (2) lays down that any scheme or arrangement made or offered by any person under which,—
```
(i) the contributions, or payments made by the investors, by whatever name called, are pooled and utilized
```

```
(ii) the contributions or payments are made to such scheme or arrangement by the investors with a view to
```
receive profits, income, produce or property, whether movable or immovable, from such scheme or arrangement;
```
(iii) the property, contribution or investment forming part of scheme or arrangement, whether identifiable or
```
not, is managed on behalf of the investors;
```
(iv) the investors do not have day-to-day control over the management and operation of the scheme or arrangement.
```
Sub-section 2A provides that any scheme or arrangement made or offered by any person shall satisfy the
conditions as may be specified in accordance with the regulations made under this Act.
```
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) or sub-section (2A) any scheme or arrangement –
```
```
(i) made or offered by a co-operative society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912 or a

The Ministry of Finance, on October 21, 2014, notified the Depository Receipts Scheme, 2014, amending and
repealing the issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares (Through Depository Receipt
Mechanism) Scheme, 1993, to the extent applicable to the issuance of depository receipts. The Scheme was
implemented, pursuant to the recommendations of the Sahoo committee to Review the FCCBs and Ordinary
Shares (Mechanism) Scheme, 1993, with a view to increase participation by Indian companies in overseas
financial markets and to facilitate raising of capital from global investors. The Scheme, governing the issue
depository receipts, came into force from December 15, 2014.
Depository Receipts are generally classified as under:
### Sponsored
A sponsored issue of depository receipts is based on a stock agreement, between the foreign depository and
the issuer of securities for the creation of the depository receipts. The sponsored depository receipts can be further classified as:

## Page 267

Lesson 10 Resource Mobilisation In International Capital Market 243
Capital Raising: The Indian issuer deposits the freshly issued securities with the domestic custodian. On the
basis of such deposit, the foreign depository then creates/issues depository receipts abroad for sale to global
investors. This constitutes a capital raising exercise, as the proceeds of the sale of depository receipts eventually go to the Indian issuer.
Non-Capital Raising: In a non-capital raising issue, no fresh underlying securities are issued. Rather, the
issuer gets holders of its existing securities to deposit these securities with a domestic custodian, so that depository
receipts can be issued abroad by the foreign depository. This is not a capital raising exercise for the Indian
issuer, as the proceeds from the sale of the depository receipts go to the holders of underlying securities.
### Unsponsored
Where there is no stock agreement between the foreign depository and the Indian issuer, any person, without
any involvement of the issuer, may deposit the securities with a domestic custodian in India. A foreign depository
then issues depository receipts abroad on the back of such deposited underlying securities. The proceeds from
the sale of such depository receipts go to the holders of the underlying securities. Based on whether a depository
receipt is traded in an organised market or in the Over the Counter (“OTC”) market, the depository receipts can be classified as listed or unlisted.
```
Listed: Listed depository receipts are traded on stock exchanges.
```
```
Unlisted: The unlisted depository receipts are those which are inter-traded between parties and where such
```
depository receipts are not listed on any stock exchanges.

60 and minimum price regulation of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 shall be complied with. SPONSORED ADR/GDR ISSUE
An Indian company can also sponsor an issue of ADR / GDR. Under this mechanism, the company offers its
resident shareholders a choice to submit their shares back to the company so that on the basis of such shares,
ADRs / GDRs can be issued abroad. The proceeds of the ADR / GDR issue are remitted back to India and
distributed among the resident investors who had offered their Rupee denominated shares for conversion.
These proceeds can be kept in Resident Foreign Currency (Domestic) accounts in India by the resident
shareholders who have tendered such shares for conversion into ADRs / GDRs.

## Page 270

246 EP-CM&SL TWO-WAY FUNGIBILITY SCHEME
A limited two-way Fungibility scheme has been put in place by the Government of India for ADRs / GDRs. Under
this Scheme, a stock broker in India, registered with SEBI, can purchase shares of an Indian company from the
market for conversion into ADRs/GDRs based on instructions received from overseas investors. Re-issuance of
ADRs / GDRs would be permitted to the extent of ADRs / GDRs which have been redeemed into underlying shares and sold in the Indian market.
# TERM ONE SHOULD KNOW
One way fungibility – Here investors could cancel their depository receipt and recover the proceeds by
selling the underlying shares in the Indian market; DRs once redeemed could not be converted into shares.
Two way fungibility – It means that the shares so released can be reconverted by the company into DRs
for purchase by the overseas investors. It implies that the re-issuance of DRs would be permitted to the
extent of DRs that have been redeemed and underlying shares are sold in domestic market.
Sponsor– It is a process of disinvestment by the Indian shareholders of their holding in overseas market.

Apart from obtaining necessary approvals, appointment of various agencies and proper documentation, the
following additional key actions are necessary for making the Euro-issue a success.
```
(i) Constitution of a Board Sub-Committee; (ii) Selection of Syndicate Members; (iii) Constitution of a task force
```
for due diligence; (iv) Listing; (v) Offering Circular; (vi) Research papers; (vii) Pre-marketing; (viii) Timing, pricing
and size of the issue; (ix) Roadshows; (x) Book building and pricing of the issue; (xi) Closing of the issue; (xii)
Allotment; (xiii) Investor Relation Programme; and (xiv) Quarterly Statement.

## Page 276

252 EP-CM&SL Constitution of a Board Sub-Committee
To launch a Euro-issue, the issuing company has to take a large number of decisions in time. These decisions
normally fall within the power of Board of Directors. It is usually difficult to call Board Meetings frequently and to
ensure presence of adequate Board Members. Thus, it is normally advisable to constitute a sub-committee of
the Board with full delegation of powers with regard to Euro-issue. The delegation of powers to the Board sub-
committee should normally include the following: – Appointment of agencies;
– Authority to make applications for seeking various approvals;
– Authority to finalise and execute documents and agreements;
– Decisions about the timing, size and pricing of the issue; and – Allotment of shares. Selection of Syndicate Members
The success of any Euro-issue depends upon the well planned and coordinated efforts of the syndicate members
and the company. The selection of the Syndicate members should be made depending upon the strength and
capabilities of each member in different areas of specialisation such as marketing, financial research, distribution
etc. The lead manager may be entrusted with the work of selection of syndicate members. The lead manager
while selecting the above members, in addition to their strength and capability, should also evaluate their standing,
image, reputation, infrastructure, past experience in handling Indian Euro-issue, etc.
Constitution of a task force for due diligence
The due diligence is a process in which a team consisting of legal, technical and financial experts of the lead
manager meets top executives of the company and visits the sites of the company in order to understand the
strengths, weaknesses, problems and opportunities of the company. The team also studies and analyses the
balance sheet of the company and its subsidiaries, its financial arrangement with the group, investment pattern

### Research Papers
Research analysts team of lead manager/co-lead manager prepares research papers on the company before
the issue. These papers are very important marketing tools as the international investors normally depend a lot
on the information provided by the research analysts for making investment decisions. Pre-marketing
Pre-marketing exercise is a tool through which the syndicate members evaluate the prospects of the issue. This

## Page 278

254 EP-CM&SL
is normally done closer to the issue. The research analysts along with the sales force of the syndicate members
meet the prospective investors during pre-marketing roadshows. This enables the syndicate members to
understand the market and the probable response from the prospective investors. The pre-marketing exercise
helps in assessing the depth of investors’ interest in the proposed issue, their view about the valuation of the
share and the geographical locations of the investors who are interested in the issue. The response received
during pre-marketing provides vital information for taking important decisions relating to timing, pricing and size
of the issue. This would also help the syndicate members in evolving strategies for marketing the issue. Timing, pricing and size of the Issue
After pre-marketing exercise, the important decisions of timing, pricing and size of the issue are taken. The
proper time of launching the issue is when the fundamentals of the company and the industry are strong and the
market price of the shares are performing well at Indian Stock Exchanges. The timing should also not clash with
some other major issues of the Indian as well as other country companies. The decision regarding the size of
issue is inversely linked with the pricing i.e. larger the size, the comparatively lower the price or vice-versa.
### Roadshows
Roadshows represent meetings of issuers, analysts and potential investors. Details about the company are
presented in the roadshows and such details usually include the following information about the company making the issue: – History – Organisational structure – Principal objects – Business lines
– Position of the company in Indian and international market – Past performance of the company – Future plans of the company
– Competition - domestic as well as foreign
– Financial results and operating performance – Valuation of shares
– Review of Indian stock market and economic situations.
Thus at road shows, series of information presentations are organised in selected cities around the
world with analysts and potential institutional investors. It is, in fact, a conference by the issuer with the prospective investors.
Road show is arranged by the lead manager by sending invitation to all prospective investors. Book building and pricing of the Issue
During road shows, the investors give indication of their willingness to buy a particular quantity at particular
terms. Their willingness is booked as orders by the marketing force of lead manager and co-lead manger. This process is known as book building.
Price is a very critical element in the market mix of any product or service. This is more so in case of financial
assets like stocks and bonds and specially in case of Euro issues. The market price abroad has a strong
correlation to the near future earnings potential, fundamentals governing industry and the basic economic state
of the country. Several other factors like prevalent practices, investor sentiment, behaviour towards issues of a
particular country, domestic market process etc., are also considered in determination of issue price. Other
factors such as the credit rating of the country, interest rate and the availability of an exit route are important.

Lesson 10 Resource Mobilisation In International Capital Market 255 Closing of the Issue and Allotment
Closing is essentially an activity confirming completion of all legal documentation and formalities based on
which the company issues the share certificate to the depository and deposits the same with the domestic
custodian. Once the issue is closed and all legal formalities are over, the allotment is finalised. Thereafter, the
company issues shares in favour of the Overseas Depository Bank and deposits the same with the domestic
custodian for custody. The particulars of the Overseas Depository Bank are required to be entered into the Register of Members of the company.
### Investor Relation Programme
The international investors expect that the issuing company maintains contact with them after the issue. These
investors always like to be informed by the company about the latest developments, the performance of the
company, the factors affecting performance and the company’s plans. It is, therefore, essential for the GDR
issuing company to set up an investor relation programme. Good investor relation ensures goodwill towards the
company and it would help the company in future fund raising efforts.
# FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGEABLE BONDS
Issue of Foreign Currency Exchangeable Bonds(FCEB) are regulated by Foreign Currency Exchangeable Bonds
Scheme, 2008 issued by Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs. What is FCEB?
```
(i) a bond expressed in foreign currency.
```
```
(ii) the principal and the interest in respect of which is payable in foreign currency.
```
```
(iii) issued by an issuing company, being an Indian company.
```
```
(iv) subscribed by a person resident outside India.
```
```
(v) Exchangeable into equity shares of another company, being offered company which is an Indian company.
```
```
(vi) Either wholly or partly or on the basis of any equity related warrants attached to debt instruments.
```
It may be noted that issuing company to be the part of promoter group of offered company and the offered
company is to be listed and is to be eligible to receive foreign investment.
The launch of the Foreign Currency Exchangeable Bonds (FCEB) scheme affords a unique opportunity for
Indian promoters to unlock value in group companies. FCEBs are another arrow in the quiver of Indian promoters
to raise money overseas to fund their new projects and acquisitions, both Indian and global, by leveraging a part
their shareholding in listed group entities. An FCEB involves three parties – (i) The issuer company (issuer), (ii) The offered company (OC) and (iii) Investor.
Under this option, an issuer company may issue FCEBs in foreign currency, and these FCEBs are convertible into
shares of another company (offered company) that forms part of the same promoter group as the issuer company.
Forexample, company ABC Ltd. issues FCEBs, then the FCEBs will be convertible into shares of company XYZ Ltd.
that are held by company ABC Ltd. and where companies ABC Ltd. and XYZ Ltd. form part of the same promoter
group. Unlike FCCBs that convert into shares of issuer itself, FCEBs are exchangeable into shares of OC. Also,
relatively, FCEB has an inherent advantage that it does not result in dilution of shareholding at the OC level.

# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FCCB AND FCEB
The essential difference between an FCCB and FCEB lies in their convertibility whereby in the case of an FCCB
offering, the bonds convert into shares of the company that issued the bonds, while in the case of an FCEB
offering, the bonds are convertible into shares not of the issuer company, but that of another company forming part of its group.
ISSUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGEABLE BONDS (FCEB) SCHEME, 2008
In Financial Year 2007-08, the Indian Government notified the Foreign Currency Exchangeable Bonds Scheme,
2008 for the issue of FCEBs. The provisions of the scheme is as under:

```
(FCCB) or External Commercial Borrowings (ECB).
```
Entities not eligible to issue FCEB: An Indian company, which is not eligible to raise funds from the Indian
securities market, including a company which has been restrained from accessing the securities market by the
SEBI shall not be eligible to issue FCEB.
Eligible subscriber: Entities complying with the FDI policy and adhering to the sectoral caps at the time of
issue of FCEB can subscribe to FCEB. Prior approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB),
wherever required under the FDI policy, should be obtained.

# FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERTIBLE BONDS
The FCCBs are unsecured, carry a fixed rate of interest and an option for conversion into a fixed number of
equity shares of the issuer company. Interest and redemption price (if conversion option is not exercised) is
payable in dollars. FCCBs shall be denominated in any freely convertible Foreign Currency. However, it must be
kept in mind that FCCB issue proceeds need to conform to ECB end use requirements.
Foreign investors also prefer FCCBs because of the dollar denominated servicing, the conversion option and,
the arbitrage opportunities presented by conversion of the FCCBs into equity at a discount on prevailing Indian market price.
In addition, 25% of the FCCB proceeds can be used for general corporate restructuring.
The major drawbacks of FCCBs are that the issuing company cannot plan its capital structure as it is not
assured of conversion of FCCBs. Moreover, the projections for cash outflow at the time of maturity cannot be made. Benefits to the Issuer Company
- Being Hybrid instrument, the coupon rate on FCCB is particularly lower than pure debt instrument there by reducing the debt financing cost.
- FCCBs are book value accretive on conversion. It saves risks of immediate equity dilution as in the case of
public shares. Unlike debt, FCCB does not require any rating nor any covenant like securities, cover etc.
- It can be raised within a month while pure debt takes a longer period to raise. Because the coupon is low
and usually payable at the time of redeeming the instrument, the cost of withholding tax is also lower for
FCCBs compared with other ECB instruments. Benefits to Investors
- It has advantage of both equity and debt.
- It gives the investor much of the upside of investment in equity, and the debt portion protects the downside.
- Assured return on bond in the form of fixed coupon rate payments.
- Ability to take advantage of price appreciation in the stock by means of warrants attached to the bonds,
which are activated when price of a stock reaches a certain point.
- Significant Yield to maturity (YTM) is guaranteed at maturity.
- Lower tax liability as compared to pure debt instruments due to lower coupon rate.

# INTRODUCTION
The world has became global village due to the technology advancement and as a result the Securities Market
have become international. Companies that previously had to raise capital in the domestic market can now tap
foreign sources of capital through ADR/GDR/FCCB/FCEB in overseas market to raise fund from international
market. As India is a preferred investment destination among international investors, the Government of India
has introduced the concept of Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs) to facilitiate listing by foreign companies on
Indian Stock Exchanges. Global banking giant Standard Chartered PLC was came out with the first issue of IDR
and listed itself on the Indian stock exchanges in the year 2010. The IDR issue by Standard Chartered PLC was
not only the first IDR offering but it was also the first public offering to complete listing and trading within the
reduced timelines of 12 working days as notified by SEBI vide its circular dated April 22, 2010.
Indian Depository Receipt means any instrument in the form of a depository receipt created by Domestic Depository
in India against the underlying equity shares of issuing company. “Domestic Depository” means custodian of
securities registered with SEBI and authorised by the issuing company to issue Indian Depository Receipts.
Overseas Custodian Bank means a banking company which is established in a country outside India and has a
place of business in India and acts as custodian for the equity shares of issuing company against which IDRs
are proposed to be issued by having a custodial arrangement or agreement with the Domestic Depository or by
establishing a place of business in India.
Process involved in issue of India Depository Receipts (IDRs)
The following flow chart describes the IDRs process :
Issuing Company (company incorporated outside India delivers equity shares to Overseas Custodian)
Overseas Custodian Bank (instructs Domestic Depository to issue
depository receipts in respect of shares held)
Domestic Depository (issues Depository Receipts to Indians against the
equity shares of the company incorporated outside India) Indians (i.e. investors of IDR issue)
Foreign shares being traded in Indian Exchanges in IDR form
ADVANTAGES OF IDR Benefits to the Issuing Company

# INTRODUCTION
In order to harmonize the various available routes for foreign portfolio investment in India, the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) introduced a new class of foreign investors in India known as the Foreign
Portfolio Investors (“FPIs”). This class has been formed by merging the existing classes of investors through
which portfolio investments were previously made in India namely, the Foreign Institutional Investors (“FIIs”),
Qualified Foreign Investors (“QFIs”) and sub-accounts of the FIIs. Previously portfolio investment was governed
under different laws i.e. the SEBI (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995 (“FII Regulations”) for FIIs
and their sub-accounts and SEBI circulars dated August 09, 2011 and January 13, 2012 governing QFIs, which
are now repealed under the SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014 (“FPI Regulations”) that govern
FPIs and are effective from 7 January 2014.

# INTRODUCTION
Before 1992, the three principal Acts governing the securities markets were:
```
(a) the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947, which restricted issuer’s access to the securities market and controlled
```
the pricing of issues; (b) the Companies Act, 1956, which sets out the code of conduct for the corporate sector
in relation to issue, allotment and transfer of securities, and disclosures to be made in public issues; and (c) the
Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, which provides for regulation of transactions in securities through
control over stock exchanges. The Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 had its origin during the war in 1943 when
the objective was to channel resources to support the war effort. The Act was retained with some modifications
as a means of controlling the raising of capital by companies and to ensure that national resources were channelled
into proper lines, i.e., for desirable purposes to serve goals and priorities of the government, and to protect the
interests of investors. Under the Act, any firm wishing to issue securities had to obtain approval from the Central
Government, which also determined the amount, type and price of the issue.
Major part of the liberalisation process was the repeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 in May 1992. With
this, Government’s control over issue of capital, pricing of the issues, fixing of premia and rates of interest on
debentures etc. ceased. The office which administered the Act was abolished and the market was allowed to
allocate resources to competing uses. However to ensure effective regulation of the market, SEBI Act, 1992 was
enacted to empower SEBI with statutory powers for (a) protecting the interests of investors in securities, (b) promoting
the development of the securities market, and (c) regulating the securities market. Its regulatory jurisdiction extends
over corporates in the issuance of capital and transfer of securities, in addition to all intermediaries and persons
associated with securities market. SEBI can specify the matters to be disclosed and the standards of disclosure
required for the protection of investors in respect of issues; can issue directions to all intermediaries and other
persons associated with the securities market in the interest of investors or of orderly development for securities
market; and can conduct enquiries, audits and inspection of all concerned and adjudicate offences under the Act.
In short, it has been given necessary autonomy and authority to regulate and develop an orderly securities market.
# OBJECTIVE OF SEBI

- To regulate, the securities market and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. SEBI ACT, 1992

and to contract, sue and be sued in its own name. SEBI has its Head Office at Mumbai and has powers to

SEBI (SETTLEMENT OFADMINISTRATIVE & CIVIL PROCEEDINGS) REGULATIONS, 2014
Under the SEBI Act,1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act,1956 (SCRA) and the Depositories Act, 1996,
SEBI pursues two streams of enforcement actions i.e. Administrative/Civil or Criminal. Administrative/civil actions
include issuing directions such as remedial orders, cease and desist orders, suspension or cancellation of
certificate of registration and imposition of monetary penalty under the respective statutes and action pursued or
defended in a court of law/tribunal. Criminal action involves initiating prosecution proceedings against violators
by filing complaint before a criminal court. Consent order is a remedial measure for settling civil proceedings initiated by SEBI.
Consent Order means an order settling administrative or civil proceedings between the regulator and a person
```
(Party) who may prima facie be found to have violated securities laws. Consent Order provides flexibility of
```
wider array of enforcement and remedial actions which will achieve the twin goals of an appropriate sanction,
remedy and deterrence without resorting to litigation, lengthy proceedings and consequent delays.
SEBI vide circular ref no. EFD/ED/Cir-1/2007 dated April 20, 2007 laid down the framework for passing of
consent orders and for considering requests for composition of offences under SEBI Act, SC(R) Act and
Depositories Act. Again in the year 2012 SEBI with the purpose of providing more clarity on its scope and
applicability, partially modified the same.

## Page 455

Lesson 17 Securities and Exchange Board of India 431
The President of India promulgated the Securities Laws (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2013 on September
16, 2013 conferring explicit powers on SEBI to settle administrative and civil proceedings under section 15JB of
the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992(SEBI Act), section 23JA of the Securities Contracts
```
(Regulation) Act, 1956 and section 19-IA of the Depositories Act, 1996.
```
The said Ordinance provided that SEBI may, after taking into consideration the nature, gravity and impact of
defaults, agree to the proposal for settlement, on payment of such sum by the defaulter or on such other terms
as may determined by SEBI in accordance with the regulations made under SEBI Act. The said Ordinance
further provided that the settlement proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure specified
in the regulations made under SEBI Act. In this direction SEBI also placed a draft consultation paper on SEBI
```
(Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2013 on its website for public comments.
```
In the light of the above, SEBI framed SEBI (Settlement of Administrative and Civil Proceedings) Regulations,
2014 and notified it vide Circular No. LAD-NRO/GN/2013-14/37/50 dated 09 January, 2014. These regulations
will enable the persons who have defaulted on any SEBI laws & civil proceedings have been initiated against
them, to settle the proceedings. These regulations do not provide for settling proceedings which are under criminal in nature.
These regulations provides for the involved entity to file settlement plea within 60 days of the show cause notice
served to them by SEBI. The charges and related costs would not be considered upon the payment of settlement
also in the cases in which the applicant has already been a party to two earlier settlements. The regulation
mentions the minimum amount to be paid by entities, which will vary as per the charges against them. These
charges will be highest for the promoters.
SEBI (Settlement of Administrative & Civil Proceedings) Regulations, 2014 is divided into VIII chapters and two
schedules. Chapter 1 covers the preliminary definitions part. Chapter II deals with the application for settlement
and limitations part. Chapter III stipulates the scope of settlement proceedings, withdrawal of application for
settlement, effect of pending application on the specified proceedings etc, Chapter V deals with the terms of
settlement like monetary and non- monetary terms, factors to be considered to arrive at the settlement terms,
Chapter V defined the role of the internal committee and high powered advisory committee in order to impart
transparency in the process, Chapter VI provides the procedure of settlement before the internal committee and
high powered advisory committee, Chapter VII deals with Settlement orders like settlement of proceeding before
the adjudicating officer and SEBI or Settlement proceeding pending before tribunal or any court, Rejection of
application in certain eventualities and chapter VIII deals with miscellaneous information like confidentiality of
information, power to remove difficulties, SEBI’s power to specify procedures, Rescission and savings etc.
Schedule I is divided into threeparts A, B & C respectively and Schedule II is again divided into seven chapters.

# INTRODUCTION
A Depository is an organization like a Central Bank where the securities of a shareholder are held in the
electronic form at the request of the shareholder through the medium of a Depository Participant. To utilize the
services offered by a Depository, the investor has to open an account with the Depository through a Depository Participant.
According to Section 2(e) of the Depositories Act, 1996. “Depository means a company formed and registered
under the Companies Act, 2013 and which has been granted a certificate of registration under Section 12(1A) of the SEBI Act, 1992”.
A depository cannot act as a depository unless it obtains a certificate of commencement of business from SEBI.
There are two Depositories functioning in India, namely the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and
the Central Depository Services (India) Limited (CDSL). Under the provisions of the Depositories Act, these
Depositories provide various services to investors and other Participants in the capital market, such as, clearing
members, stock exchanges, investment institutions, banks and issuing corporates. These include basic facilities
like account opening, dematerialization, settlement of trades and advanced facilities like pledging, distribution of
non-cash corporate actions, distribution of securities to allottees in case of public issues, etc.
All the securities held by a depository shall be dematerialized and shall be in a fungible form. To utilize the
services offered by a depository, the investor has to open an account with the depository through a participant,
similar to the opening of an account with any of the bank branches to utilize services of that bank. Registration
of the depository is required under SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 and is a precondition
to the functioning of the depository. Depository and depository participant both are regulated by SEBI.
Difference between Depository and Custodian
Both depository and custodial services are responsible for safe keeping of securities but they are different in the
sense that the Depository can legally transfer beneficial ownership, which a custodian cannot. The main objective
of a Depository is to minimize the paper work involved with the ownership, trading and transfer of securities.
# BENEFITS OF DEPOSITORY SYSTEM
In the depository system, the ownership and transfer of securities takes place by means of electronic book
entries. At the outset, this system rids the capital market of the dangers related to handling of paper. The system
provides numerous direct and indirect benefits, like:
Elimination of bad deliveries - In the depository environment, once holdings of an investor are dematerialised,
the question of bad delivery does not arise i.e. they cannot be held "under objection". In the physical environment,
buyer of shares was required to take the risk of transfer and face uncertainty of the quality of assets purchased.
In a depository environment good money certainly begets good quality of assets.
Elimination of all risks associated with physical certificates- Dealing in physical securities have associated
security risks of theft of stocks, mutilation of certificates, loss of certificates during movements through and from
the registrars, thus exposing the investor to the cost of obtaining duplicate certificates and advertisements, etc.
This problem does not arise in the depository environment.
Immediate transfer and registration of securities - In the depository environment, once the securities are
credited to the investors account on pay out, he becomes the legal owner of the securities. There is no further
need to send it to the company's registrar for registration. Having purchased securities in the physical environment,
the investor has to send it to the company's registrar so that the change of ownership can be registered. This
process usually takes around three to four months and is rarely completed within the statutory framework of two

## Page 463

Lesson 18 Depositories 439
months thus exposing the investor to opportunity cost of delay in transfer and to risk of loss in transit. To
overcome this, the normally accepted practice is to hold the securities in street names i.e. not to register the
change of ownership. However, if the investors miss a book closure the securities are not good for delivery and
the investor would also stand to loose his corporate entitlements.
Faster disbursement of non cash corporate benefits like rights, bonus, etc. – Depository system provides
for direct credit of non cash corporate entitlements to an investors account, thereby ensuring faster disbursement
and avoiding risk of loss of certificates in transit.
Reduction in brokerage by many brokers for trading in dematerialized securities - Brokers provide this
benefit to investors as dealing in dematerialized securities reduces their back office cost of handling paper and
also eliminates the risk of being the introducing broker.
Reduction in handling of huge volumes of paper and periodic status reports to investors on their holdings and
transactions, leading to better controls.
Elimination of problems related to change of address of investor, transmission, etc. - In case of change of
address or transmission of demat shares, investors are saved from undergoing the entire change procedure
with each company or registrar. Investors have to only inform their DP with all relevant documents and the
required changes are effected in the database of all the companies, where the investor is a registered holder of securities.
Elimination of problems related to selling securities on behalf of a minor - A natural guardian is not required
to take court approval for selling demat securities on behalf of a minor. DEPOSITORY SYSTEM - AN OVERVIEW
The Depository System functions very much like the banking system. A bank holds funds in accounts whereas
a Depository holds securities in accounts for its clients. A Bank transfers funds between accounts whereas a
Depository transfers securities between accounts. In both systems, the transfer of funds or securities happens
without the actual handling of funds or securities. Both the Banks and the Depository are accountable for the
safe keeping of funds and securities respectively.
In the depository system, share certificates belonging to the investors are to be dematerialized and their names
are required to be entered in the records of depository as beneficial owners. Consequent to these changes, the
investors’ names in the companies’ register are replaced by the name of depository as the registered owner of
the securities. The depository, however, does not have any voting rights or other economic rights in respect of
the shares as a registered owner. The beneficial owner continues to enjoy all the rights and benefits and is
subject to all the liabilities in respect of the securities held by a depository. Shares in the depository mode are
fungible and cease to have distinctive numbers. The transfer of ownership changes in the depository is done
automatically on the basis of delivery vs. payment.
In the Depository mode, corporate actions such as IPOs, rights, conversions, bonus, mergers/amalgamations,
subdivisions & consolidations are carried out without the movement of papers, saving both cost & time. Information
of beneficiary owners is readily available. The issuer gets information on changes in shareholding pattern on a
regular basis, which enables the issuer to efficiently monitor the changes in shareholdings.
The Depository system links the issuing corporates, Depository Participants (DPs), the Depositories and clearing
corporation/ clearing house of stock exchanges. This network facilitates holding of securities in the soft form and
effects transfers by means of account transfers.
Following presentation about depositories reveal all about depositories, its concepts and trading, i.e. models of
depositories, Depository functions, Legal linkage, depository participant, Registrars and issuers, dematerialisation,
rematerialisation, electronic credit in new issues, trading system, corporate action.

# MODELS OF DEPOSITORY
Immobilisation – Where physical share certificates are kept in vaults with the depository for safe custody. All
subsequent transactions in these securities take place in book entry form. The actual owner has the right to
withdraw his physical securities as and when desired. The immobilization of fresh issue may be achieved by
issuing a jumbo certificate representing the entire issue in the name of depository, as nominee of the beneficial owners.
Dematerialisation– No Physical scrip in existence, only electronic records maintained by depository. This type
of system is cost effective and simple and has been adopted in India.
### Dematerialization
Dematerialization is a process by which the physical share certificates of an investor are taken back by the
Company and an equivalent number of securities are credited his account in electronic form at the request of the
investor. An investor will have to first open an account with a Depository Participant and then request for the
dematerialization of his share certificates through the Depository Participant so that the dematerialized holdings
can be credited into that account. This is very similar to opening a Bank Account.
Dematerialization of shares is optional and an investor can still hold shares in physical form. However, he/she
has to demat the shares if he/she wishes to sell the same through the Stock Exchanges. Similarly, if an investor
purchases shares from the Stock Exchange, he/she will get delivery of the shares in demat form. Odd lot share
certificates can also be dematerialized.

# DEPOSITORY PARTICIPANT
Just as a brokers act an agent of the investor at the Stock Exchange; a Depository Participant (DP) is the
representative (agent) of the investor in the depository system providing the link between the Company and
investor through the Depository. The Depository Participant maintains securities account balances and intimate
the status of holding to the account holder from time to time. According to SEBI guidelines, Financial Institutions
like banks, custodians, stockbrokers etc. can become participants in the depository. A DP is one with whom an
investor needs to open an account to deal in shares in electronic form. While the Depository can be compared
to a Bank, DP is like a branch of that bank with which an account can be opened. The main characteristics of a depository participant are as under: – Acts as an Agent of Depository – Customer interface of Depository – Functions like Securities Bank – Account opening – Facilitates dematerialisation – Instant transfer on pay-out
– Credits to investor in IPO, rights, bonus – Settles trades in electronic segment REGISTRAR/ISSUER – Dematerialisation – Confirmation of Beneficiary Holdings
– Corporate Actions – Rights, Bonus, etc. – Reconciliation of Depository Holdings – Rematerialisation
DEMATERIALISATION – Investor opens account with DP
– Fills Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF) for registered shares
– Investor lodges DRF and certificates with DP – DP intimates the Depository – Depository intimates Registrar/Issuer
– DP sends certificates and DRF to Registrar/Issuer
– Registrar/Issuer confirms demat to Depository – Depository credits investor a/c
# REMATERIALISATION

Lesson 18 Depositories 443
The legal framework for depository system in the Depositories Act, 1996 provides for the establishment of single
or multiple depositories. Any body to be eligible for providing depository services must be formed and registered
as a company under the Companies Act, 2013 and seek registration with SEBI and obtain a Certificate of
Commencement of Business from SEBI on fulfillment of the prescribed conditions. The investors opting to join
depository mode are required to enter into an agreement with depository through a participant who acts as an
agent of depository. The agencies such as custodians, banks, financial institutions, large corporate brokerage
firms, non-banking financial companies etc. act as participants of depositories. The companies issuing securities
are also required to enter into an agreement with the Depository. THE DEPOSITORIES ACT, 1996
# OBJECTIVES
The depositories legislation as per the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Depositories Act, 1996 aims at providing for:
– A legal basis for establishment of depositories to conduct the task of maintenance of ownership records
of securities and effect changes in ownership records through book entry;
– Dematerilisation of securities in the depositories mode as well as giving option to an investor to choose
between holding securities in physical mode and holding securities in a dematerialized form in a depository; – Making the securities fungible;
– Making the shares, debentures and any interest thereon of a public limited company freely transferable; and
– Exempting all transfers of shares within a depository from stamp duty.
# ELIGIBILITY CONDITION FOR DEPOSITORY SERVICES
Any company or other institution to be eligible to provide depository services must:
– be formed and registered as a company under the Companies Act, 2013.
– be registered with SEBI as a depository under SEBI Act, 1992.
– has framed bye-laws with the previous approval of SEBI.
– has one or more participants to render depository services on its behalf.
– has adequate systems and safeguards to prevent manipulation of records and transactions to the satisfaction of SEBI.
– complies with Depositories Act, 1996 and SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996.
– meets eligibility criteria in terms of constitution, network, etc.
# ELIGIBLE SECURITIES REQUIRED TO BE IN THE DEPOSITORY MODE
Section 8 of the Depositories Act gives the option to the investors to receive securities in physical form or in depository mode.
It is not necessary that all eligible securities must be in the depository mode. In the scheme of the Depositories
legislation, the investor has been given supremacy. The investor has the choice of holding physical securities or
opt for a depository based ownership record.
However, in case of fresh issue of securities all securities issued have to be in dematerialized form. However

## Page 468

444 EP-CM&SL
after that investor will also have the freedom to switch from depository mode to non-depository mode and vice
versa. The decision as to whether or not to hold securities within the depository mode and if in depository mode,
which depository or participant, would be entirely with the investor.
# FUNGIBILITY
Section 9 states that securities in depositories shall be in fungible form.
The Act envisages that all securities held in depository shall be fungible i.e. all certificates of the same security
shall become interchangeable in the sense that investor loses the right to obtain the exact certificate he surrenders
at the time of entry into depository. It is like withdrawing money from the bank without bothering about the distinctive numbers of the currencies.
Immobilisation of securities in a depository mode refers to a situation where the depository holds securities in
the form of physical paper side by side with electronic evidence of ownership. In such a case the transfers are
not accompanied by physical movement of securities but securities are in existence in the custody of the depository.
However, the Depositories Act, envisages dematerialisation in the depository mode. In such a case the securities
held in a depository shall be dematerialized and the ownership of the securities shall be reflected through book
entry only. The securities outside the depository shall be represented by physical scrips. Hence, the depository
legislation envisages partial dematerialisation, i.e. a portion of the securities in dematerialized form and the
other portion in physical form. (Sections 89 and 186 of Companies Act, 2013 shall not apply to a depository in
respect of shares held on behalf of beneficial owners in depositories).
# RIGHTS OF DEPOSITORIES AND BENEFICIAL OWNER
A depository should be deemed to be the registered owner for the purposes of effecting transfer of ownership of
security on behalf of a beneficial owner. The depository as a registered owner should not have any voting rights
or any other rights in respect of securities held by it. The beneficial owner is entitled to all the rights and benefits
and be subjected to all the liabilities in respect of his securities held by a depository.
# REGISTER OF BENEFICIAL OWNER
Every depository is required to maintain a register and an index of beneficial owners in the manner provided in the Companies Act, 2013.
RECORDING OF NON DISPOSAL UNDERTAKING (NDU) IN THE DEPOSITORY SYSTEM
SEBI has allowed depositories to offer a system for recording of non-disposal undertaking (NDU). In this direction,
the depositories are advised the following:
- Depositories shall develop a separate module/ transaction type in their system for recording NDUs.
- Both parties to the NDU shall have a demat account with the same depository and be KYC compliant.
- Pursuant to entering the NDU, the Beneficial Owner (BO) along with the other party shall make an
application through the participant (where the BO holds his securities) to the depository, for the purpose of recording the NDU transaction.
- The application shall necessarily include details of BO ID, PAN, email-id, signature(s), name of the
entity in whose favour such NDU is entered and the quantity of securities. Such entity in whose favour
NDU is entered shall also authorize the participant of the BO holding the shares, to access the signatures
as recorded in that entity’s demat account.
- The participant after being satisfied that the securities are available for NDU shall record the NDU and
freeze for debit the requisite quantity of securities under NDU in the depository system. .
- The depositories shall make suitable provisions for capturing the details of BO ID and PAN of the entity

## Page 469

Lesson 18 Depositories 445
in whose favour such NDU is entered by the participant. The depositories shall also make available to
the said participant, the details of authorized signatories as recorded in the demat account of the entity in whose favour such NDU is entered.
- On creation of freeze in the depository system, the depository/ participant of the BO holding shares,
shall inform both parties of the NDU regarding creation of freeze under NDU.
- The depositories shall make suitable provisions for capturing the details of company/ promoters if they are part of the NDU.
- In case if the participant does not create the NDU, it shall intimate the same to the parties of the NDU along with the reasons thereof.
- Once the freeze for debits is created under the NDU for a particular quantity of shares, the depository
shall not facilitate or effect any transfer, pledge, hypothecation, lending, rematerialisation or in any
manner alienate or otherwise allow dealing in the shares held under NDU till receipt of instructions from
both parties for the cancellation of NDU.
- The entry of NDU made above may be cancelled by the depository/ participant of the BO through
unfreeze of specified quantity if parties to the NDU jointly make such application to the depository through the participant of the BO.
- On unfreeze of shares upon termination/ cancellation of NDU, the depository shall inform both parties of
the NDU in the form and manner agreed upon at the time of creating the freeze. The unfreeze shall be
effected in the depository system after a cooling period of 2 clear business days but no later than 4 clear business days.
The freeze and unfreeze instructions executed by the Participant for recording NDUs will be subject to 100%
concurrent audit. The DPs shall not facilitate or be a party to any NDU outside the depository system as outlined herein.
# PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION OF SECURITIES HELD IN A DEPOSITORY
A beneficial owner may with the previous approval of the depository create a pledge or hypothecation in respect
of a security owned by him through a depository. Every beneficial owner should give intimation of such pledge or
hypothecation to the depository participant and such depository is required to make entries in its records
accordingly. Any entry in the records of a depository should be evidence of a pledge or hypothecation.
# FURNISHING OF INFORMATION AND RECORDS BY DEPOSITORY AND ISSUER
Every depository shall furnish to the issuer information about the transfer of securities in the name of beneficial
owners at such intervals and in such manner as may be specified by the bye-laws. Every issuer shall make
available to the depository copies of the relevant records in respect of securities held by such depository.
# OPTION TO OPT OUT IN RESPECT OF ANY SECURITY
Section 14 of the Act provides that if a beneficial owner seeks to opt out of a depository in respect of any
security he should inform the depository accordingly. After the receipt of intimation the depository should
make appropriate entries in its records and also inform the issuer. Every issuer may, within thirty days of the
receipt of intimation from the depository and on fulfillment of such conditions and on payment of such fees as
may be specified by the regulations, issue the certificate of securities to the beneficial owner or the transferee, as the case may be.
# DEPOSITORIES TO INDEMNIFY LOSS IN CERTAIN CASES
Any loss caused to the beneficial owner due to the negligence of the depository or the participant, would be

## Page 470

446 EP-CM&SL
indemnified by the depository to such beneficial owner. Where the loss due to the negligence of the participant
is indemnified by the depository, the depository has the right to recover the same from such participant.
# FRAMEWORK OF CAPACITY PLANNING FOR THE DEPOSITORIES
SEBI has issued Capacity Planning Framework for the Depositories which prescribes mandatory requirements
for depositories while planning capacities for their operations as discussed below:
- The installed capacity shall be at least 1.5 times of the projected peak load.
- The projected peak load shall be calculated for the next 60 days based on the per hour peak load trend of the past 180 days.
- The Depositories shall ensure that the utilisation of resources in such a manner so as to achieve work
completion in 70% of the allocated time.
- All systems pertaining to Depository operations shall be considered in this process including all technical
components such as network, hardware, software, etc., and shall be adequately sized to meet the capacity requirements.
- In case the actual capacity utilisation exceeds 75% of the installed capacity for a period of 15 days on a
rolling basis, immediate action shall be taken to enhance the capacity.
- The actual capacity utilisation shall be monitored especially during the period of the day in which pay-in
and pay-out of securities takes place for meeting settlement obligations.
Depositories shall implement suitable mechanisms, including generation of appropriate alerts, to monitor capacity
utilisation on a real-time basis and shall proactively address issues pertaining to their capacity needs.
# POWER OF SEBI
Section 18 of the Act provides that SEBI in the public interest or in the interest of investors may by order in
writing to call upon any issuer, depository, participant or beneficial owner to furnish in writing such information
relating to the securities held in a depository as it may require; or authorise any person to make an enquiry or

the depository or issuer or the participant or beneficial owner shall on demand produce before the person
making the enquiry or inspection all information or such records and other documents in his custody having a
bearing on the subject matter of such enquiry or inspection.
# POWER OF SEBI TO GIVE DIRECTIONS

Lesson 18 Depositories 461
for handling of physical share work and an outside agency for handling the work of electronic connectivity. This
kind of arrangement is leading to delay in dematerialization, non-reconciliation of shareholding due to lack of
proper co-ordination among the concerned agencies or departments, which is adversely affecting the interest of the investors.
SEBI therefore vide its circular D&CC/FITTC/CIR-15/2002 dated December 27, 2002 decided that all the work

With a view to achieve wider financial inclusion, encourage holding of demat accounts and to reduce the cost of
maintaining securities in demat accounts for retail individual investors, SEBI introduced the concept of basic
services demat account (BSDA). All depository participants (DPs) shall make available a "Basic Services Demat
Account" (BSDA) with limited services and reduced costs compared to conventional demat accounts. These
BSDA will also offer SMS alert facility for debit transactions.
### Eligible Investor
The “Basic Services Demat Account” (BSDA) promises to provide limited services at reduced costs to retail
investors. All individual who currently have one account or plan to open an demat account where they are the
sole or first holder will be allowed to open the BSDA. However, the value of securities held will not be more than
` 2 lakh at any given point of time. However, Investors can open only one BSDA across all DPs.
An existing eligible individual who holds a demat account with a DP can convert demat account into BSDA on the
date of the next billing cycle based on value of holding of securities as on the last day of previous billing cycle.
SEBI vide its circular dated December 11, 2015 advised the DPs to convert all the eligible demat accounts into
BSDA unless such Beneficial Owners (BOs) specificallyOPT continue to avail the facilities of a regular demat account.
### Charges
The Annual Maintenance Charges (AMC) which will have to pay for BSDA will be as per pre-determined slabs.
If the value of holdings is up to ` 50,000 there won’t be any annual maintenance charge. However, if the value
of holding is in between` 50,001 to` 200,000, a fee of` 100 as AMC may be charged. If the value of holdings
exceeds, DPs are permitted to charge the same as they charge non- BSDA regular demat accounts. Valuation of Holding
The value of holding shall be determined on the basis of the daily closing price or Net Asset Value of the
securities or units of mutual funds. Where such price is not available the last traded price may be taken into
account and for unlisted securities other than units of mutual funds, face value may be taken in to account.
Statements (a) Transaction statements:
```
(a) Transaction statements shall be sent to the beneficial owner (BO) at the end of each quarter. If there are
```
no transactions in any quarter, no transaction statement may be sent for that quarter.
```
(b) If there are no transactions and no security balance in an account, then no further transaction statement needs to be provided.
```
```
(c) Transaction statement shall be required to be provided for the quarter in which the account became a zero balance account. (b) Holding Statement:
```
```
(a) One annual physical statement of holding shall be sent to the stated address of the BO in respect of
```
accounts with no transaction and nil balance.

## Page 487

Lesson 18 Depositories 463
- One annual statement of holding shall be sent in respect of remaining accounts in physical or electronic form as opted for by the BO. Charges for statements
Electronic statements shall be provided free of cost. However, for physical statements, DPs have to provide
two statements free of cost to the account holder during the billing cycle. But additional statements will be
charged a fee, which cannot be more than ` 25. All BOs opting for the facility of BSDA shall register their
mobile number for availing the SMS alert facility for debit transaction. Atleast two delivery instruction slip shall be issued at the time of account opening.
However, in order to reduce the cost of compliance of DPs, the following rationalization measures have been prescribed for regular accounts:
```
(a) Accounts with zero balance and nil transactions during the year: The DPs shall send one physical
```
statement of holding annually to such BOs and shall resume sending the transaction statement as and
when there is a transaction in the account.
```
(b) Accounts which become zero balance during the year: For such accounts, no transaction statement
```
may be sent for the duration when the balance remains nil. However, an annual statement of holding shall be sent to the Beneficiary Owner.
```
(c) Accounts with credit balance: For accounts with credit balance but no transactions during the year, one
```
statement of holding for the year shall be sent to the BO.

# INTRODUCTION
Listing of securities with stock exchange is a matter of great importance for companies and investors, because
this provides the liquidity to the securities in the market. Any company offering its shares to the public for
subscription is required to be listed on the stock exchange and has to comply with the conditions as provided in
the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009. According to the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements)
Regulations, 2009, [(SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009)], a company has to file a draft offer document along with
prescribed fees to SEBI through the lead merchant banker, at least thirty days prior to registering the prospectus
with the Registrar of Companies. The company has to obtain in-principle approval from recognised stock
exchanges in which the company proposes to get its securities listed. A company is required to complete the
allotment of securities offered to the public and/or refund the application moneys within fifteen days from the date of closure of the issue.
In addition, a company intending to have its share listed has to comply with the listing requirements prescribed
by the Stock Exchange. A company seeking listing of their securities on the Stock Exchange is required to enter
into a formal listing agreement with the Stock Exchange.SEBI has prescribed and also specified all the quantitative
and qualitative requirements to be continuously complied with by the issuer for continued listing. The Stock
Exchange monitors such compliance and companies who do not comply with the provisions of the listing
agreement may be suspended from trading on the Stock Exchange.
Only public companies are allowed to list their securities in the stock exchange. Private Limited companies
cannot get listing facility. They should first convert themselves into public limited companies and their Articles of
Association should also contain prohibitions as laid down in the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘LODR Regulations’) and as applicable to public limited companies.
# TYPES OF LISTING
Listing of securities falls under 5 groups –
### Initial Listing
If the shares or securities are to be listed for the first time by a company on a stock exchange is called initial listing. Listing for Public Issue
When a company whose shares are listed on a stock exchange comes out with a public issue of securities, it
has to list such issue with the stock exchange. Listing for Rights Issue
When companies whose securities are listed on the stock exchange issue securities to existing shareholders on
rights basis, it has to list such rights issues on the concerned stock exchange. Listing of Bonus Shares
Shares issued as a result of capitalisation of profit through bonus issue shall list such issues also on the concerned stock exchange. Listing for merger or amalgamation
When new shares are issued by an amalgamated company to the shareholders of the amalgamating company,
such shares are also required to be listed on the concerned stock exchange.

# BENEFITS OF LISTING
The following benefits are available when securities are listed by a company in the stock exchange–
```
(1) Public image of the company is enhanced.
```
```
(2) The liquidity of the security is ensured making it easy to buy and sell the securities in the stock exchange.
```
```
(3) Tax concessions are made available both to the investors and the companies.
```
```
(4) Listing procedure compels company management to disclose important information to the investors
```
enabling them to make crucial decisions with regard to keeping or disposing of such securities.
```
(5) Listed companies command better support such as loans and investments from Banks and FIs.
```
# LEGAL PROVISION ON LISTING
According to Section 40(1) of the Companies Act 2013, every company which intends to make public offer of
securities should make an application to one or more recognised stock exchanges before making such offer.
Sub section 2 of this Section provides that the company shall state the name of the stock exchanges on which its securities will be dealt with.
Section 24 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides that, any company which is listed or intend to get their securities
listed on any recognised stock exchange will be administered by regulation prepared by SEBI for matters relating
to issue and transfer of securities and non payment of dividend.
As per Section 4 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, every recognised stock exchange has the
powers to make bye-laws for the listing of securities on the stock exchange, inclusion of any security for the
purpose of dealings and suspension or withdrawal of securities and the prohibition of trading in any specified security, subject to SEBI approval.
Every company while submitting its application for listing with the stock exchange(s) should produce a number
of documents as enclosures to satisfy the requirements of the concerned stock exchange. It should also give a
number of undertakings as a condition precedent before listing as sought by the concerned stock exchange.
Finally when the stock exchange(s) agree(s) to list the securities, the company shall execute a listing agreement with the stock exchange(s).
When a company signs a listing agreement with a stock exchange, it means it has entered into a legally binding
contract with that stock exchange and it has to ensure compliance of each and every term and condition of the
listing agreement. For failure to ensure such compliance the stock exchange can take an action against the
company after giving an opportunity of being heard.
Listing of Securities on Indian Stock Exchanges, thus, is governed by the provisions in the SEBI (Listing Obligations
and Disclosure Requirments) Regulations, 2015, Companies Act, 2013, the Securities Contracts (Regulation)
Act, 1956, the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, Rules, bye laws, regulations of concerned stock
exchange and circulars/guidelines issued by the Central Government and SEBI.
COMPLIANCES UNDER SEBI (LISTING OBLIGATIONS AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS) REGULATIONS, 2015
SEBI has notified SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“Listing

The Kumar Mangalam Birla Committee Constituted by SEBI has observed that:
“Strong corporate governance is indispensable to resilient and vibrant capital markets and is an important
instrument of investor protection. It is the blood that fills the veins of transparent corporate disclosure and high-
quality accounting practices. It is the muscle that moves a viable and accessible financial reporting structure.”
N.R. Narayana Murthy Committee on Corporate Governance constituted by SEBI has observed that:
“Corporate Governance is the acceptance by management of the inalienable rights of shareholders as the
true owners of the corporation and of their own role as trustees on behalf of the shareholders. It is about
commitment to values, about ethical business conduct and about making a distinction between personal and
corporate funds in the management of a company.”
The Institute of Company Secretaries of India has also defined the term Corporate Governance as under:
Good Governance in capital market has always been high on the agenda of SEBI. Corporate Governance is
looked upon as a distinctive brand and benchmark in the profile of Corporate Excellence. This is evident from
the continuous updation of guidelines, rules and regulations by SEBI for ensuring transparency and accountability.
In the process, SEBI had constituted a Committee on Corporate Governance under the Chairmanship of Shri
Kumar Mangalam Birla. The Committee in its report observed that “the strong Corporate Governance is
indispensable to resilient and vibrant capital markets and is an important instrument of investor protection. It is
the blood that fills the veins of transparent corporate disclosure and high quality accounting practices. It is the
muscle that moves a viable and accessible financial reporting structure.”
Based on the recommendations of the Committee, the SEBI had specified principles of Corporate Governance
and introduced a new clause 49 in the Listing agreement of the Stock Exchanges in the year 2000. These
principles of Corporate Governance were made applicable in a phased manner and all the listed companies
with the paid up capital of Rs 3 crores and above or net worth of Rs 25 crores or more at any time in the history
of the company, were covered as of March 31, 2003.
SEBI, as part of its endeavour to improve the standards of corporate governance in line with the needs of a
dynamic market, constituted another Committee on Corporate Governance under the Chairmanship of Shri N.
R. Narayana Murthy to review the performance of Corporate Governance and to determine the role of companies
in responding to rumour and other price sensitive information circulating in the market in order to enhance the
transparency and integrity of the market. The Committee in its Report observed that “the effectiveness of a
system of Corporate Governance cannot be legislated by law, nor can any system of Corporate Governance be
static. In a dynamic environment, system of Corporate Governance need to be continually evolved.”
With a view to promote and raise the standards of Corporate Governance, SEBI on the basis of recommendations
of the Committee and public comments received on the report and in exercise of powers conferred by Section
11(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with section 10 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act 1956, revised the
existing clause 49 of the Listing agreement vide its circular SEBI/MRD/SE/31/2003/26/08 dated August 26, 2003.
SEBI vide circular number SEBI/CFD/ DIL/CG/1/2004/12/10 dated October 29, 2004 again revised the existing
Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement directing all the Stock Exchanges to amend the Listing Agreement by
replacing the existing Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement. As per the Circular, the provisions of the Clause 49
were to be implemented as per the schedule of implementation given below:
```
(a) For entities seeking listing for the first time, at the time of seeking in-principle approval for such listing.
```
```
(b) For existing listed entities which were required to comply with Clause 49 which is being revised i.e.
```
those having a paid up share capital of Rs. 3 crores and above or net worth of Rs. 25 crores or more at
any time in the history of the company, by April 1, 2005.
However, noticing that large number of companies were not in the state of preparedness to be fully compliant
with the requirements of revised Clause 49 of the listing agreement, SEBI allowed more time to corporates to
conform to Clause 49 of the listing agreement and extended the date for ensuring compliance with the Clause
49 of the listing agreement to December 31, 2005.

# DELISTING
The term “delisting” of securities means permanent removal of securities of a listed company from a stock
exchange. As a consequence of delisting, the securities of that company would no longer be traded at that stock
exchange. Delisting can be Voluntary or Compulsory.
In its continuous endeavour, SEBI in the year 2002 constituted a committee on delisting of shares to inter-alia
examine and review the conditions for delisting of securities of companies listed on recognized stock exchanges
and suggest norms and procedures in connection therewith. The Report of the Committee was considered
and accepted by SEBI. Pursuant to the same, SEBI issued the SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Guidelines, 2003.
The said Guidelines, although, to a great extent covered the issues involved in Delisting of Securities. However,
there were certain areas over which hue and cry was made from various quarters. Various representations and

views, from intermediaries, stock exchanges, shareholders’ associations, chambers of commerce, etc., were
given to the Regulators on the operational issues and procedural complications in the guidelines. Based on
such representations, it was proposed to look into and suggest changes in the guidelines. In the month of April
2004, the initial changes proposing more systemic clarity were put up for public comments. Comments were
received from various quarters and opinions were received on crucial provisions. SEBI circulated Concept
Paper on the proposed SEBI (Delisting of Securities) Regulations, 2006, asking for public comments on the
proposed Regulations. SEBI received various comments, opinions and suggestions on the subject and finally,
by its publication dated 10th June 2009 in the Official Gazette, SEBI notified the SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009.
# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMPULSORYAND VOLUNTARY DELISTING
Compulsory delisting refers to permanent removal of securities of a listed company from a stock exchange as a
penalizing measure at the behest of the stock exchange for not making submissions/comply with various
requirements set out in the Listing agreement within the time frames prescribed. In voluntary delisting, a listed
company decides on its own to permanently remove its securities from a stock exchange.

# INTRODUCTION
Management of a public issue involves coordination of activities and cooperation of a number of agencies such
as managers to the issue, underwriters, brokers, registrar to the issue; solicitors/legal advisors, printers, publicity
and advertising agents, financial institutions, auditors and other Government/Statutory agencies such as Registrar
of Companies, Reserve Bank of India, SEBI etc. The whole process of issue of shares can be divided into two
parts (i) pre-issue activities and (ii) post issue activities. All activities beginning with the planning of capital issue
till the opening of the subscription list are pre-issue activities while all activities subsequent to the opening of the
subscription list may be called post issue activities. Since only the demat shares are being admitted for dealings
on the stock exchanges, hence the securities can be issued only with the purpose of alloting the shares in Dematerialised Form.
With the repeal of Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 all the guidelines, notifications, circulars etc. issued by the
office of the Controller of Capital Issues have become defunct. Earlier, such companies were required to conform
to the guidelines issued by SEBI vide its order dated 11.6.1992 called the Guidelines for Disclosure and Investor Protection, 1992.
SEBI had issued a compendium containing consolidated Guidelines, circulars, instructions relating to issue of
capital effective from January 27, 2000. The compendium titled SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection)
Guidelines, 2000 replaced the original Guidelines issued in June 1992 and clarifications thereof. On August 26,
2009 SEBI rescinded the SEBI (DIP) Guidelines, 2000 and notified SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2009 in order to bring more clarity to the provisions of the rescinded SEBI Guidelines
by removing the redundant provision and modifying certain provisions on account of changes necessitated due to market design.
# ISSUE OF EQUITY SHARES

```
```
(e) Qualified institutions placement by a listed issuer;

However, if more than 50% of the net tangible assets are held in monetary assets, the issuer has made firm
commitments to utilise such excess monetary assets in its business or project. Further the limit of 50% on
monetary assets shall not be applicable in case the public offer is made entirely through an offer for sale.

the parameters, SEBI has provided alternative route to company not satisfying any of the above conditions, for
accessing the Primary Market, if the issue is made through the book-building process and the issuer undertakes
to allot, at least seventy five percent of the net offer to public, to qualified institutional buyers and to refund full
subscription money if it fails to make the said minimum allotment to qualified institutional buyers. An issuer shall
not make an allotment pursuant to a public issue if the member of prospective allottees is less than one thousand.
Further, an issuer shall not make an initial public offer if there are any outstanding convertible securities or any
other right which would entitle any person with any option to receive equity shares.
# TYPES OF ISSUE
Public Issue of shares means the selling or marketing of shares for subscription by the public by issue of
prospectus. For raising capital from the public by the issue of shares, a public company has to comply with the
provisions of the Companies Act, the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 including the Rules made
thereunder and the guidelines and instructions issued by the concerned Government authorities, the Stock Exchanges and SEBI etc.
A company can raise funds from the primary market through different method:
```
(a) Public issue: When an issue/offer of securities is made to new investors for becoming part of
```
shareholders’ family of the issuer it is called a public issue. Public issue can be further classified into
Initial public offer (IPO) and Further public offer (FPO). The significant features of each type of public issue are illustrated below:

## Page 556

532 EP-CM&SL
```
(i) Initial public offer (IPO): When an unlisted company makes either a fresh issue of securities or
```
offers its existing securities for sale or both for the first time to the public, it is called an IPO. This
paves way for listing and trading of the issuer’s securities in the Stock Exchanges.
```
(ii) Further public offer (FPO) or Follow on offer: When an already listed company makes either a
```
fresh issue of securities to the public or an offer for sale to the public, it is called a FPO.
```
(b) Right issue (RI):When an issue of securities is made by an issuer to its shareholders existing as on a
```
particular date fixed by the issuer (i.e. record date), it is called a rights issue. The rights are offered in a
particular ratio to the number of securities held as on the record date.
```
(c) Bonus issue:When an issuer makes an issue of securities to its existing shareholders as on a record
```
date, without any consideration from them, it is called a bonus issue. The shares are issued out of the
Company’s free reserve or share premium account in a particular ratio to the number of securities held on a record date.
```
(d) Private placement: When an issuer makes an issue of securities to a select group of persons not
```
exceeding 49, and which is neither a rights issue nor a public issue, it is called a private placement.
Private placement of shares or convertible securities by listed issuer can be of two types:
```
(i) Preferential allotment: When a listed issuer issues shares or convertible securities, to a select
```
group of persons in terms of provisions of Chapter VII of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, it is called a
preferential allotment. The issuer is required to comply with various provisions which inter alia
include pricing, disclosures in the notice, lock in etc., in addition to the requirements specified in the Companies Act, 2013.
```
(ii) Qualified institutions placement (QIP): When a listed issuer issues equity shares or securities
```
convertible into equity shares to Qualified Institutions Buyers (QIBs) only in terms of provisions of
Chapter VIII of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, it is called a QIP.
```
(iii) Institutional placement programme (IPP): When a listed issuer makes a further public offer of
```
equity shares, or offer for sale of shares by promoter / promoter group of listed issuer in which, the
offer allocation and allotment of such shares is made only to QIBs in terms of chapter VIIIA of SEBI
```
(ICDR) Regulations, 2009 for the purpose of achieving minimum public shareholding it is called an IPP.

are made in the offer document about such non-compliances during the three years immediately preceding

# BONUS SHARES
A company may, if its Articles provide, capitalize its profits by issuing fully-paid bonus shares. The issue of bonus
shares by a company is a common feature. When a company is prosperous and accumulates large distributable
profits, it converts these accumulated profits into capital and divides the capital among the existing members in
proportion to their entitlements. Members do not have to pay any amount for such shares. They are given free.
The bonus shares allotted to the members do not represent taxable income in their hands. [Commissioner of
Income Tax, Madras v. A.A.V. Ramchandra Chettiar (1964) 1 Mad CJ 281]. Issue of bonus shares is a bare
machinery for capitalizing undistributed profits. The vesting of the rights in the bonus shares takes place when
the shares are actually allotted and not from any earlier date.
# ADVANTAGES OF ISSUING BONUS SHARES
## 1. Fund flow is not affected adversely.
## 2. Market value of the Company’s shares comes down to their nominal value by issue of bonus shares.
## 3. Market value of the members’ shareholdings increases with the increase in number of shares in the company.
## 4. Bonus shares is not an income. Hence it is not a taxable income.
## 5. Paid-up share capital increases with the issue of bonus shares.

## Page 596

572 EP-CM&SL
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013, securities premium account can be used
in paying up unissued shares of the company to be issued to its members as fully-paid bonus shares. Other free
reserves created from out of the profits actually earned during earlier years like general reserve, capital redemption
reserve account, devolvement rebate reserve etc. can be utilised by company for issue of fully paid bonus shares to its members.
There are no guidelines on issuing bonus shares by private or unlisted companies. However, SEBI has notified
Regulations for Bonus Issue which are contained in Chapter IX of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2009 with regard to bonus issues by listed companies.
When a company has accumulated free reserves and is desirous of bridging the gap between the capital and
fixed assets, it issues bonus shares to its equity shareholders. Such an issue would not place any fresh funds in
the hands of the company. On the contrary, after a bonus issue it would become necessary for the company to
earn more to effectively service the increased capital. The shareholder will, however, be benefitted by way of
increased return on investment and increased number of shares in their hands.
The following conditions must be satisfied before issuing bonus shares:
```
(a) Bonus Issue must be authorised by the articles of the company. Such a provision is generally there
```
in articles of almost all the companies as they adopt Table A. Schedule I of the Companies Act, 2013
```
(Regulation 96) of ICDR Regulations, 2009.
```
```
(b) Bonus Issue must be sanctioned by shareholders in general meeting on recommendation of the Board of directors of the company.
```
```
(c) Regulations issued by SEBI must be complied with.
```
```
(d) Authorised Capital must be increased where necessary.
```
# SEBI REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO BONUS ISSUE
## 1. Out of Free Reserves
The bonus issue is to be made out of free reserves built out of the genuine profits or securities premium collected in cash only.
## 2. Revaluation Reserves
The reserves created by revaluation of fixed assets should not be capitalised. These reserves are in fact capital
reserves. However, if the assets are subsequently sold and the profits are realised, such profits could be utilised
for capitalisation purposes. In fact the Government has in the past approved issue of bonus shares out of capital
reserves representing realised capital profits.
## 3. Bonus Issue not to be in lieu of Dividend
Bonus issue should not be made in lieu of dividend.
## 4. Fully Paid Shares
If there are any partly paid-up shares outstanding on the date of allotment, these shares should be made fully paid-up before the bonus issue is made.
## 5. No Default in respect of Fixed Deposits/Debentures
The company should not have defaulted in the payment of any interest or principal in respect of its fixed deposits, debt securities issued by it.

of fully convertible debentures, partly convertible debentures or any other financial instruments that could be
converted into equity shares at a later date. The investors could be institutional investors, private equity investors,
high net-worth individuals, or companies.

the retail investors. It is like a wholesale market, where institutions with financial clout are allowed to participate.
This deprives investment opportunity to the retail investors.

# INTRODUCTION
The capital market intermediaries are vital link between investor, issuer and regulator. The objective of these
intermediaries is to smoothen the process of investment and to establish a link between the investors and the
users of funds. Corporations and Governments do not market their securities directly to the investors. Instead,
they hire the services of the market intermediaries to represent them to the investors. Investors, particularly
small investors, find it difficult to make direct investment. A small investor desiring to invest may not find a willing
and desirable borrower. He may not be able to diversify across borrowers to reduce risk. He may not be equipped
to assess and monitor the credit risk of borrowers. Market intermediaries help investors to select investments by
providing investment consultancy, market analysis and credit rating of investment instruments. In order to operate
in secondary market, the investors have to transact through share brokers. Registrars and Share Transfer
Agents, Custodians and Depositories are capital market intermediaries that provide important infrastructure
services for both primary and secondary markets.
According to SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, “intermediary” means a person mentioned in clauses (b)
and (ba) of sub-section (2) of section 11 and sub-section (1) and (1A) of section 12 of the Act and includes an asset
management company in relation to the SEBI(Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, a clearing member of a clearing
corporation or clearing house and a trading member of a derivative segment or currency derivatives segment of a
stock exchangebut does not include foreign institutional investor, foreign venture capital investor, mutual
fund, collective investment scheme and venture capital fund.
The market Regulator, SEBI regulates various intermediaries in the primary and secondary markets through its
Regulations for these intermediaries. SEBI has defined the role of each of the intermediary, the eligibility criteria
for granting registration, their functions and responsibilities and the code of conduct to which they are bound.
These Regulations also empower SEBI to inspect the functioning of these intermediaries and to collect fees
from them and to impose penalties on erring entities. As per Section 11 of SEBI Act, it is the duty of SEBI to
register and regulate the working of stock brokers, sub-brokers, share transfer agents, bankers to an issue,
trsutees of trust deeds, registrars to an issue, merchant bankers, underwriters, portfolio managers, investment
advisers and such other intermediaries who may be associated with securities market in any manner.
SEBI has issued regulations in respect of each intermediary to ensure proper services to be rendered by them
to the investors and the capital market which is discussed below.
# ROLE OF CAPITAL MARKET INTERMEDIARIES
The role of intermediaries makes the market vibrant, and to function smoothly and continuously. Intermediaries
possess professional expertise and play a promotional role in organising a perfect match between the supply
and demand for capital in the market. All those, institutions or individuals, who help to bring the savers and
seekers of capital and enable a regular flow of funds from supply to demand points are intermediaries. All
intermediaries are service providers and are an integral part of the Securities Market.
These market intermediaries provide different types of financial services to the investors. They are constantly
operating in the financial market. It is in their (market intermediaries) own interest to behave rationally, maintain
integrity and to protect and maintain reputation, otherwise the investors would not be trusting them next time. In
principle, these intermediaries bring efficiency to corporate fund raising by developing expertise in pricing new
issues and marketing them to the investors.
Presently this lesson briefly covers in a nutshell the core functions of each one of the intermediaries operating in the Primary and the Secondary markets.
The following market intermediaries are involved in the Securities Market:  Merchant Bankers

# UNDERWRITERS
Underwriter means a person who engages in the business of underwriting of an issue of securities of a body corporate.
Underwriting is an arrangement whereby certain parties assure the issuing company to take up shares, debentures
or other securities to a specified extent in case the public subscription does not amount to the expected levels.
For this purpose, an arrangement (agreement) will be entered into between the issuing company and the assuring
party such as a financial institution, banks, merchant banker, broker or other person.

## Page 646

622 EP-CM&SL
Underwriting is compulsory for a public issue. It is necessary for a public company which invites public subscription
for its securities to ensure that its issue is fully subscribed. The company cannot depend on its advertisements
to bring in the full subscription. In case of any short-fall, it has to be made good by underwriting arrangements
made in advance of the opening of the public issue.
It is the underwriter who agrees to take up securities which are not fully subscribed in a public issue. The
underwriter makes a commitment to get the issue subscribing either by others or by themselves.
The lead managers are required to satisfy themselves about the networth of the underwriters and their outstanding
commitments and disclose the same to SEBI. In this connection, each underwriter should furnish an undertaking
to the lead manager about their networth and outstanding commitments. Both the lead managers and the
directors are required to give a statement in the prospectus that in their opinion the underwriters have the
necessary resources to discharge their liabilities, if any, in full. Penal action will be taken against underwriters for
not taking up the assured amount of security in case of development and to debar them from the underwriting public issues in future. SEBI (UNDERWRITERS) REGULATIONS, 1993

A sub-broker is one who works along with the main broker and is not directly registered with the stock exchange
as a member. Sub-broker means any person not being a member of stock exchange who acts on behalf of a
stock broker as an agent or otherwise for assisting the investors in buying, selling or dealing in securities through such stock brokers.
A stock broker plays a very important role in the secondary market helping both the seller and the buyer of the
securities to enter into a transaction. The buyer and seller may be either a broker or a client. The transaction
entered cannot be annulled except in the case of fraud, willful misrepresentation or upon prima-facie evidence
of a material mistake in the transaction, in the judgement of the existing authorities. If a member of the stock
exchange (broker) has orders to buy and to sell the same kind of securities, he may complete the transaction between his clients concerned.
When executing an order, the stock broker may on behalf of his client buy or sell securities from his own account
i.e. as principal or act as an agent. For each transaction he has to issue necessary contract note indicating
whether the transaction has been entered into by him as a principal or as an agent for another. While buying or
selling securities as a principal, the stock broker has to obtain the consent of his client and the prices charged
should be fair and justified by the conditions of the market.

– All suspicious transactions whether or not made in cash and including inter alia, credits or debits into
from any non-monetary account such as demat account, security account maintained by the registered intermediary.
It may, however, be clarified that for the purpose of suspicious transactions, reporting apart from ‘transactions
integrally connected’, ‘transactions remotely connected or related should also be considered.
SEBI has laid down the minimum requirements / disclosures to be made in respect of clients. The intermediaries
are required to specify additional disclosures to be made by clients to address concerns of Money Laundering
and suspicious transactions undertaken by clients, according to their requirements.

## Page 687

Lesson 21 Regulatory Framework relating to Securities Market Intermediaries 663
The intermediaries are also required to designate an officer as ‘Principal Officer’ who would be responsible for
ensuring compliance of the provisions of the PMLA and also designate a person as a ‘Designated Director’ on
whom the director, FIU-IND can take appropriate action including levying monetary penalty on the designated
director for failure of the intermediary to comply with any of its AML/CFT obligation.
Each registered intermediary should adopt written procedures to implement the anti money laundering provisions
as envisaged under the Anti Money Laundering Act, 2002. Such procedures should includeinter alia, the following
three specific parameters which are related to the overall ‘Client Due Diligence Process’: (a) Policy for acceptance of clients
```
(b) Procedure for identifying the clients
```
```
(c) Transaction monitoring and reporting especially Suspicious Transactions Reporting (STR)
```
OBLIGATIONS OF INTERMEDIARIES UNDER PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING ACT, 2002

been valued below the prescribed limit so as to defeat the provisions of this section, such officer shall furnish
information in respect of such transactions to the Director within the prescribed time.
The records shall be maintained for a period of ten years from the date of cessation of the transactions between

– Inconsistency in the payment pattern by client

# CLIENT IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURE
The ‘Know your Client’ (KYC) policy should clearly spell out the client identification procedure to be carried out
at different stages i.e. while establishing the intermediary – client relationship, while carrying out transactions for
the client or when the intermediary has doubts regarding the veracity or the adequacy of previously obtained
client identification data. SEBI has prescribed the minimum requirements relating to KYC for certain class of the
registered intermediaries from time to time. Taking into account the basic principles enshrined in the KYC norms
which have already been prescribed or which may be prescribed by SEBI from time to time, all registered
intermediaries should frame their own internal guidelines based on their experience in dealing with their clients
and legal requirements as per the established practices. Further, the intermediary should also maintain continuous
familiarity and follow-up where it notices inconsistencies in the information provided. The underlying principle
should be to follow the principles enshrined in the PML Act, 2002 as well as the SEBI Act, 1992 so that the
intermediary is aware of the clients on whose behalf it is dealing.
# INFORMATION TO BE MAINTAINED
Intermediaries are required to maintain and preserve the following information in respect of transactions mentioned above. (i) the nature of the transactions;
```
(ii) the amount of the transaction and the currency in which it was denominated;
```
```
(iii) the date on which the transaction was conducted; and (iv) the parties to the transaction.
```
# MAINTENANCE AND PRESERVATION OF RECORDS
Intermediaries are required to take appropriate steps to evolve an internal mechanism for proper maintenance
and preservation of such records and information in a manner that allows easy and quick retrieval of data as and
when requested by the competent authorities. Further, the records have to be maintained and preserved for a
period of ten years from the date of cessation of the transactions between the client and intermediary.
Records evidencing the identity of its clients and beneficial owners as well account files and business
correspondence shall be maintained and preserved for a period of five years after the business relationship
between a client and intermediary has ended or the account has been closed, whichever is later.
REPORTING TO FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT-INDIA
In terms of the PMLA rules, intermediaries are required to report information relating to cash and suspicious
transactions to the Director, Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) at the following address: Director, FIU-IND, Financial Intelligence Unit-India, 6th Floor, Hotel Samrat, Koutilya Marg, Chanakyapuri, New Delhi-110021. Website: http://fiuindia.gov.in
The Intermediaries are required to adhere to the following:
```
(a) The cash transaction report (CTR) (wherever applicable) for each month should be submitted to FIU- IND by 15th of the succeeding month.
```
```
(b) The Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) should be submitted within 7 days of arriving at a conclusion
```

## Page 690

666 EP-CM&SL
that any transaction, whether cash or non-cash, or a series of transactions integrally connected are of
suspicious nature. The Principal Officer should record his reasons for treating any transaction or a
series of transactions as suspicious. It should be ensured that there is no undue delay in arriving at such a conclusion.
```
(c) The Principal Officer is responsible for timely submission of CTR and STR to FIU-IND;
```
```
(d) Utmost confidentiality is to be maintained in filing of CTR and STR to FIU-IND. The reports may be
```
transmitted by speed/registered post/fax at the notified address.
The Trading Member should not put any restrictions on operations in the accounts where an STR has been
made. Further, it should be ensured that there is no tipping off to the client at any level.
It is clarified that the registered intermediaries, irrespective of the amount of transaction and/or the threshold
limit envisaged for predicate offences specified in Part B of Schedule of PMLA, 2002, should file STR if they
have reasonable grounds to believe that the transactions involve proceeds of crime. SEBI (INTERMEDIARIES) REGULATIONS, 2008
In the present regime a dozen regulations govern different categories of intermediaries. The broad framework of
such regulations is similar to one another.SEBI in exercise of the powers conferred by section 30 of the Securities
and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 issued the SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 which seek to
consolidate the common requirements and put in place a comprehensive framework which will apply to the
intermediaries and prescribe the obligations, procedure, limitations etc. in so far as the common requirements
are concerned. The new regulations seek to simplify procedures to make the registration/ regulation process of
intermediaries less burdensome and cost effective without diluting the regulatory oversight. The regulation is
primarily principle based and some significant changes in the framework are given below :
## 1. Permanent Registration
Subject to compliance with the SEBI Act, regulations, updation of relevant disclosures and payment of fees registration shall be permanent.
## 2. Registration for multiple activities
The process for registration for undertaking multiple activities by the same intermediary has been simplified.
## 3. Registration Form- information divided into two parts

be retained with SEBI as regulatory filing.
## 4. Fit and Proper person requirements
The criteria to determine whether the intermediary is a Fit and Proper person have been revised and are now principle based.
## 5. Suspension/Cancellation of certificate of registration
The manner of suspension/cancellation of any certificate granted to any person has been provided in the
regulations. Consequently, the SEBI (Procedure for holding enquiry by enquiry officer and imposing penalty)
Regulations, 2002 has been repealed and SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008 has taken place.

i. preparation or publication of the content of the research report; or ii. providing research report; or

Explanation.-The term also includes any associated person who reports directly or indirectly to such a research
analyst in connection with activities provided above;
Timely and accurate information about investment products is an important ingredient for making investment
decisions. However, considering the volume and complexity of information it would be difficult for an investor for
analyzing and grasping the information. In this context the Research Analysts play an important role. They study
Companies and industries, analyze raw data, and make forecasts or recommendations about whether to buy,
hold or sell securities. They analyze information to provide recommendations about investments in securities to
their clients. Investors often view analysts as experts and important sources of information about the securities
they review and often rely on their advice. There are basically three broad types of analysts, viz. sell-side
analysts, buy-side analysts and independent analysts.
– Sell-side Analysts- They typically publish research reports on the securities of companies or industries
that they cover. These Research reports carry specific recommendations, such as recommendation to
buy, hold, or sell the subject security. It also includes the analyst’s expectation of the future price
performance of the security (“price target”).
– Buy-side Analysts-They generally work for money managers like mutual funds, hedge funds,
pension funds, or portfolio managers that purchase and sell securities for their own investment accounts
or on behalf of others. Research reports of these analysts are generally circulated among the top
management of the employer firms as these reports contain advice about which securities to buy, hold or sell.
– Independent Analysts- They work for research originators or boutique firms that are legal entities
separate from full-service investment firms and sell their research to others on a subscription or other basis.
The activities of Research Analyst in India are governed by the SEBI (Research Analysts) Regulations, 2014.

# INTRODUCTION
The practice of Insider Trading came into existence ever since the very concept of trading of securities of a
company became prevalent among the investors worldwide and has now become a formidable challenge for investors all over the world.
The United State of America was the first country to formally enact a legislation to regulate insider trading. Over
the years, most of the jurisdictions around the world have recognized the requirement to restrict insider trading
in one form or other and accordingly put in place legal restrictions to this effect.
India was not late in recognizing the detrimental impact of insider trading. The history of Insider Trading in India
relates back to the 1940’s with the formulation of government committees such as the Thomas Committee
under the chairmanship of Mr. P.J.Thomas to evaluate restrictions that can be imposed on short swing profit of
1948, which evaluated inter alia, the regulations in the US on short swing profits under Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act, 1934. Thereafter in India provisions relating to Insider Trading were incorporated in the Companies
Act, 1956 under Sections 307 and 308, which required shareholding disclosures by the directors and managers
of a company. Due to inadequate provisions of enforcement in the companies Act, 1956, the Sachar Committee
in 1979, the Patel Committee in 1986 and the Abid Hussain Committee in 1989 proposed recommendations for
a separate statute regulating Insider Trading.
The Patel committee in 1986 in India defined Insider Trading as:
“ Insider trading generally means trading in the shares of a company by the persons who are in the management
of the company or are close to them on the basis of undisclosed price sensitive information regarding the
working of the company, which they possess but which is not available to others.”
The concept of Insider Trading in India started fermenting in the 80’s and 90’s and came to be known and
observed extensively in the Indian Securities market. As mentioned earlier due to inadequate provisions in the
Companies Act, 1956 and rapidly advancing Indian Securities market needed a more comprehensive legislation
to regulate the practice of Insider Trading, thus resulting in the formulation of the SEBI (Insider Trading) Regulations
in the year 1992, which were amended in the year 2002 after the discrepancies observed in the 1992 regulations
in the cases like Hindustan Levers Ltd. vs. SEBI, Rakesh Agarwal vs. SEBI, etc. to remove the lacunae existing
in the Regulations of 1992. The amendment in 2002 came to be known as the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992.
Further, the PIT Regulations, 1992 had their challenges in their drafting, interpretation and reach. Besides, the
felt need to ensure a clear regulatory policy that is not only easily comprehendible but is also comprehensive led
to this Committee being set up under the chairmanship of Justice N. K. Sodhi, Former Chief Justice of the High
Courts of Kerala and Karnataka and a Former Presiding Officer of the Securities Appellate Tribunal. The High
Level Committee reviewed the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 submitted its report to SEBI on December 7, 2013.
The Committee made a range of recommendations to the legal framework for prohibition of insider trading in
India and has focused on making this area of regulation more predictable, precise and clear by suggesting a
combination of principles-based regulations and rules that are backed by principles. The Committee had also
suggested that each regulatory provision might be backed by a note on legislative intent.
SEBI has issued and notified the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 (Regulations) on 15th
January, 2015 based on recommendations of Sodhi committee. These Regulations became effective from120th
day of the date of notification i.e. on and from 15th May, 2015, by repealing SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations 1992.
The new regulations strengthen the legal and enforcement framework, align Indian regime with international

practices, provide clarity with respect to the definitions and concepts, and facilitate legitimate business transactions.
Now a big step taken forward by introduction of the insider trading provisions in the Companies Act, 2013. As
per the Companies Act, 2013 provisions it prohibits directors and key managerial personnel from purchasing
call and put options of shares of the company, its holding company and its subsidiary and associate companies
as if such person is reasonably expected to have access to price-sensitive information (being information
which, if published, is likely to affect the price of the company’s securities). Earlier these provisions were
contained in regulations framed by SEBI, as the capital market regulator. Now, it has also been informed that
SEBI is expected to discuss changes in certain norms for listed firms so as to make them in line with the rules in the new Act.
The definition of price sensitive information has also been included. No person including any director or KMP of
a company shall enter into insider trading except any communication required in the ordinary course of business
or profession or employment or under any law. While the Companies Act, 1956 was silent on the provisions
relating to insider trading, the Companies Act, 2013 on the other hand, lays down provisions relating to prohibition
of insider trading with respect to all companies. This is a step towards harmonization between the 2013 Act and
the SEBI Act; more specifically for listed companies; Any person who violates the clause will be punished with a cash fine or imprisonment or both.
PROVISIONS RELATING TO INSIDER TRADING IN COMPANIES ACT, 2013
Section 195 of the Companies Act, 2013 deals with the provisions on prohibition on insider trading of securities, which is as under:

reasonably expected to have access to any non-public price sensitive information in respect of securities of company, or
```
(ii) an act of counselling about, procuring or communicating directly or indirectly any non- public price sensitive information to any person;
```
```
(b) “price-sensitive information” means any information which relates, directly or indirectly, to a company
```
and which if published is likely to materially affect the price of securities of the company.
Sub-section (2) provides that If any person contravenes the provisions of this section, he shall be punishable
with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or with fine which shall not be less than five lakh
rupees but which may extend to twenty-five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of insider
trading, whichever is higher, or with both.
Powers delegated to SEBI under Companies Act 2013
Section 458 (1) states that the Central Government may, by notification, and subject to such conditions, limitations
and restrictions as may be specified therein, delegate any of its powers or functions under this Act other than the
power to make rules to such authority or officer as may be specified in the notification:

securities listed and in such case, any officer authorised by the SEBI shall have the power to file a complaint in the court of competent jurisdiction

# INTRODUCTION
Takeover code prescribes a systematic framework for acquisition of stake in listed companies. By these laws the
regulatory system ensures that the interests of the shareholders of listed companies are not compromised in
case of an acquisition or takeover. It also protect the interests of minority shareholders, which is also a fundamental
attribute of corporate governance principle.
The takeover code ensures that public shareholders of a listed company are treated fairly and equitably in
relation to a substantial acquisition in, or takeover of, a listed company thereby maintaining stability in the
securities market. The objective of the takeover regulations is to ensure that the public shareholders of a company
are mandatorily offered an exit opportunity from the company at the best possible terms in case of a substantial
acquisition in, or change in control of, a listed company.
The earliest attempts at regulating takeovers in India can be traced back to the 1990s with the incorporation
of Clause 40 in the earstwhile Listing Agreement. While, the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and
Takeovers) Regulations, 1994 which were notified in November 1994 made way for regulation of hostile
takeovers and competitive offers for the first time; the subsequent regulatory experience from such offers
brought out certain inadequacies existing in those Regulations. As a result, the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition
of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997 were introduced and notified on February 20, 1997, pursuant to repeal of the 1994 Regulations.
Owing to several factors such as the growth of Mergers & Acquisitions activity in India as the preferred mode of
restructuring, the increasing sophistication of takeover market, the decade long regulatory experience and various
judicial pronouncements, it was felt necessary to review the Takeover Regulations 1997. Accordingly, SEBI
formed a Takeover Regulations Advisory Committee (TRAC) in September 2009 under the Chairmanship of
```
(Late) Shri. C. Achuthan, Former Presiding Officer, Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) for this purpose. After
```
extensive public consultation on the report submitted by TRAC, SEBI came out with the SAST Regulations 2011
which were notified on September 23, 2011. The Takeover Regulations, 1997 stand repealed from October 22,
2011, i.e. the date on which SAST Regulations, 2011 come into force.
SAST aims at protecting interest of the investors in securities of a listed company providing amongst others,
an opportunity for the public shareholders to exit where there is a substantial acquisition of shares or voting
rights or control over a listed company, consolidation of holdings by existing shareholders and related
disclosures and penalties for non-compliance etc. SAST requires an acquirer to make an offer to shareholders
of the target company on acquiring shares exceeding stipulated thresholds. It also contains provisions relating
to open offer size and price, time bound process for making an open offer, exemption from making an open offer, etc.
SEBI (SUBSTANTIALACQUISITION OF SHARESAND TAKEOVERS) REGULATIONS, 2011
The SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011, comprises of six chapters and
one schedules encompassing the various regulations related to Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers.
Chapter I (Regulation 1 – 2) deals mainly with the definitions used in these regulation. Chapter II (Regulation 3-
11) provides for substantial acquisition of shares, Voting Rights or Control, threshold limit for open offer. It also
contains the exemption available to the company. Chapter III (Regulation 12-23) narrates the open offer process
and deals with concept related to open offer. Chapter IV (Regulation 24-27) deals with the other obligations of
target company, Acquirer, Manager etc., Chapter V (Regulation 28-31) deals with disclosure requirements of
Shareholding and control and limit for making disclosures. Chapter VI (Regulation 32-35) deals with miscellaneous
provisions relating to powers of SEBI and its right to issue directions.

Lesson 23 Takeover Code – An Overview 717 What is Takeover?
When an "Acquirer" takes over the control of the "Target Company", it is termed as Takeover. When an
acquirer acquires "substantial quantity of shares or voting rights" of the Target Company, it results into substantial acquisition of shares.
# IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS
To understand the concept of the takeover code, it would be pertinent to first go through some of the definitions :
### Acquirer
“Acquirer” means any person who, directly or indirectly, acquires or agrees to acquire whether by himself, or
through, or with persons acting in concert with him, shares or voting rights in, or control over a target company.
### Acquisition
“Acquisition” means, directly or indirectly, acquiring or agreeing to acquire shares or voting rights in, or control over, a target company.
### Control
“Control” includes the right to appoint majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions
exercisable by a person or persons acting individually or in concert, directly or indirectly, including by virtue of their
shareholding or management rights or shareholders agreements or voting agreements or in any other manner.
However, a director or officer of a target company shall not be considered to be in control over such target
company, merely by virtue of holding such position. Enterprise value
Enterprise value means the value calculated as market capitalization of a company plus debt, minority interest
and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents.
Enterprise Value= Market capitalization+ Debt+ Minority Interest and Preferred Shares- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents Frequently traded shares
Frequently traded shares means shares of a target company, in which the traded turnover on any stock exchange
during the twelve calendar months preceding the calendar month in which the public announcement is made, is
at least ten per cent of the total number of shares of such class of the target company.
However, where the share capital of a particular class of shares of the target company is not identical throughout
such period, the weighted average number of total shares of such class of the target company shall represent the total number of shares. Offer period
“Offer period” means the period between the date of entering into an agreement, formal or informal, to acquire
shares, voting rights in, or control over a target company requiring a public announcement, or the date of the
public announcement, as the case may be, and the date on which the payment of consideration to shareholders

the Acquirer or PACs with him has acquired shares of the Target Company without attracting the obligation
to make a Public Announcement of an Open Offer. This condition is given because the Voluntary Open
Offer is permitted as an exception to the general rule on the offer size, thus the ability to voluntarily make

within the creeping acquisition limits permitted under the Regulations.

According to Regulation 6A, any person who is a wilful defaulter shall not make a public announcement of an
open offer for acquiring shares or enter into any transaction that would attract the obligation to make a public
announcement of an open offer for acquiring shares.

conditional offer. If the number of shares validly tendered in the conditional offer, are less than the minimum level
of acceptance stipulated by the acquirer, then the acquirer is not bound to accept any shares under the offer.

# INTRODUCTION
The securities market operations promote the economic growth of the country. More efficient is the securities
market, the greater is the promotion effect on economic growth. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that securities
market operations are more efficient, transparent and safe. In this context, the investors need protection from
the various malpractices and unfair practices made by the corporate and intermediaries. As the individual investors’
community and the investment avenues are on the rise, it is interesting to know how the investors shall be
protected through various legislations. Securities market in general are to be regulated to improve the market
operations in fair dealings and easy to access the market by corporate and investors. The present positive
attitude of investors is heartening though investor sentiments have been shaken by the various scandals. Even
though, there are various opportunities available for investment, investors are scared of investing. In this situation,
the individual investors’ protection becomes necessary to sustain the economic development of the country.
The desired level of economic growth of a country is dependent upon availability of protection to its investors’.
Globally, there is increased evidence to suggest that investor protection has assumed an important role in the
economic development of a country. Integrity of the financial markets and economic well being of the country
depend on corporate accountability and investors confidence. The global concern to make capital markets safer
and transparent can be achieved by strengthening financial system and managing the crisis efficiently. The
revival of investors’ protection in the corporate securities market is necessary to make market more efficient by
means of converting savings to investment. If the investors are not protected properly by way of providing fair
rate of return and safeguarding their capital, the corporate will not be able to mobilize funds from the market at
reasonable rate in times to come. In view of the foregoing with a view to gain the confidence of investors in the
securities market it is necessary to provide adequate rate of return on investors’ capital by corporates through
their operational efficiency. This will enable us to lure back investors to the capital market. This can be done by
a series of systematic measures which would build their confidence in the systems and processes and protect the interest of investors. INVESTORS’ RIGHTSAND RESPONSIBILITIES
Equity shareholders are the real owner of the company and with the growth of the company equity shareholders

transfer the commercial banks have initiated various measures for creating awareness through Financial Literacy
and Counseling Centers and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes on financial literacy. The objective of
these centers is to advise people on gaining access to the financial system including banks, creating awareness

among the public about financial management, counseling people who are struggling to meet their repayment
obligations and help them resolve their problems of indebtedness, helping in rehabilitation of borrowers in
distress etc. Some of these credit counseling centers even train farmers/women groups to enable them to start
their own income generating activities to earn a reasonable livelihood. Even top management of commercial
banks is undertaking Outreach visits to villages with a view to spread financial literacy.
Similarly, many Stock Exchanges, Broking Houses and Mutual Funds have initiatives in the field of financial
education that spawns conducting of seminars, issuance of do's and don'ts and newspaper campaigns. Insurance
companies too, carry out campaigns and other educational activities for generic education in insurance.
# INVESTOR GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL MECHANISM AT SEBI
# INVESTOR GRIEVANCES
There will be occasions when an investor has a complaint against, a listed company or an intermediary registered
with SEBI. In the event of such complaint, the investor should first approach the concerned company/ intermediary
against whom there is a complaint. Sometimes the response received may not be satisfactory. Therefore, investors
should know as to which authority they should approach, to get their complaints redressed. SCORES (SEBI COMPLAINTS REDRESS SYSTEM)
SCORES is a web based centralized grievance redress system of SEBI (http://scores.gov.in). SCORES enables
investors to lodge and follow up their complaints and track the status of redressal of such complaints online from
the above website from anywhere. This enables the market intermediaries and listed companies to receive the
complaints online from investors, redress such complaints and report redressal online. All the activities starting
from lodging of a complaint till its closure by SEBI would be online in an automated environment and the
complainant can view the status of his complaint online. An investor, who is not familiar with SCORES or does
not have access to SCORES, can lodge complaints in physical form at any of the offices of SEBI. Such complaints
would be scanned and also uploaded in SCORES for processing. The salient features of SCORES are:
– SCORES is web enabled and provides online access 24 x 7;
– Complaints and reminders thereon can be lodged online at the above website at anytime from anywhere;
– An email is generated instantaneously acknowledging the receipt of complaint and allotting a unique
complaint registration number to the complainant for future reference and tracking;
– The complaint forwarded online to the entity concerned for its redressal;
– The entity concerned uploads an Action Taken Report (ATR) on the complaint;
– SEBI peruses the ATR and closes the complaint if it is satisfied that the complaint has been redressed adequately;
– The concerned investor can view the status of the complaint online from the above website by logging
in the unique complaint registration number;
– The entity concerned and the concerned investor can seek and provide clarification on his complaint online to each other;
– Every complaint has an audit trail; and
– All the complaints are saved in a central database which generates relevant MIS reports to enable SEBI
to take appropriate policy decisions and/or remedial actions, if any.

## Page 783

Lesson 24 Investor Protection 759 How to lodge complaint in SCORES?
To register a complaint online on SCORES portal, (http://scores.gov.in) click on “Complaint Registration” under
“Investor Corner”. The complaint registration form contains personal details and complaint details. There are
certain mandatory fields in the Form. These fields include Name, Address for correspondence, State, Email
Address of Investor. After filling the personal details, select the complaint category, entity name, nature of complaint
related to, complaint details in brief (up to 1000 characters). A PDF document (up to 1MB of size for each nature
of complaint) can also be attached along with the complaint as the supporting document. On successful submission
of complaint, system generated unique registration number will be displayed on the screen which may be noted
for future correspondence. An email acknowledging the complaint with complaint registration number will also
be sent to the complainant’s email id entered in the complaint registration form.
What are the limitations in dealing with complaints?
To make efficient complaints redressal mechanism through SCORES, it is mandated by SEBI to all stock brokers
and DPs that they shall redress the complaintswithin 15 days from the date of receipt of compliant. In case
of additional information required from the complainant, then it should be redresswithin 7 days from the date of
receipt of compliant, the period of 15 days shall be count from the receipt of additional information.
Sometimes a complaint is successfully resolved and the entity is advised to send reply to complainant. But in
certain cases, the entity or company denies wrongdoing, and it remains unclear as to who is wrong or whether
any wrongdoing occurred at all. If this happens, SEBI cannot act as a judge or an arbitrator and force the entity
or company to resolve the complaint. Further, SEBI cannot act as personal representative or attorney of the
complainant. Securities laws and other laws provide important legal rights and remedies if an investor has
suffered wrongdoing. On their own, investors can also seek to resolve their complaint through the courts, consumer courts, or arbitration.
When can a case be referred for arbitration?
If the grievance is not resolved by the Stock Exchange/Depository due to disputes, an investor can file arbitration
subject to the Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations of the exchange / Depository. All claims, differences or disputes
between the investors and stock brokers/depository participants can be filed for arbitration. To obtain information
about when and how to file an arbitration claim, please visit:
### Bombay Stock Exchange

```
### National Stock Exchange

Simplified arbitration can be a less costly alternative to legal recourse before the courts of law. If the investor has
an account with the broker or a depository participant (DP), he/she can choose arbitration to settle disputes. The
investor generally cannot pursue an issue through arbitration if it is barred by limitation prescribed. When deciding
whether to arbitrate, the investor has to bear in mind that if the broker or DP goes out of business or declares
bankruptcy, he/she might not be able to recover money even if the arbitrator or court rules in his/her favor. However,
with certain restriction to the nature of transactions, Stock Exchanges may settle on case to case basis the claim of
an investor up to a limit prescribed in the “Investor protection fund” guidelines of the respective Stock Exchange.

## Page 784

760 EP-CM&SL
The claimant is required to carefully review the rules governing simplified arbitration before filing a claim and
should also weigh the costs of arbitrating against the likelihood of being able to collect any award in favor. An
investor, who has a claim / counter claim upto `10 lakh and files arbitration reference for the same within six
months, need not make any deposit for filing arbitration.
When can SEBI take action for non resolution of the complaint?
While the entity is directly responsible for redressal of the complaint, SEBI initiates action against recalcitrant
entities on the grounds of their unsatisfactory redressal of large number of investor complaints as a whole.
Which are the matters that are not considered as complaints by SEBI?
– Complaints that are incomplete or not specific
– Allegations without supporting documents
– Offering suggestions or seeking guidance/explanation
– Seeking explanation for non-trading of shares or illiquidity of shares
– Not satisfied with trading price of the shares of the companies
– Non-listing of shares of private offer
– Disputes arise out of private agreement with companies/intermediaries. SEBI (INFORMAL GUIDANCE) SCHEME, 2003

Lesson 24 Investor Protection 761
25,000/- and addressed to the concerned Department of SEBI. It should also describe the request, disclose and
analyse all material facts and circumstances involved and mention all applicable legal provisions. SEBI may
dispose off the request as early as possible and in any case not later than 60 days after the receipt of the
request. The Department may give a hearing or conduct an interview if it feels necessary to do so. The requestor
shall be entitled only to the reply. The internal records or views of SEBI shall be confidential.
SEBI may not respond to the following types of requests:
```
(a) those which are general and those which do not completely and sufficiently describe the factual situation;
```
```
(b) those which involve hypothetical situations;
```
```
(c) those requests in which the requestor has no direct or proximate interest;
```
```
(d) where the applicable legal provisions are not cited;
```
```
(e) where a no action or interpretive letter has already been issued by that or any other department on a
```
substantially similar question involving substantially similar facts, as that to which the request relates;
```
(f) those cases in which investigation, enquiry or other enforcement action has already been initiated;
```
```
(g) those cases where connected issues are pending before any Tribunal or Court and on issues which are subjudice; and,
```
```
(h) those cases where policy concerns require that the Department does not respond.
```
Where a request is rejected for non-compliance, the fee if any paid by the requestor shall be refunded to him
after deducting therefrom a sum of ` 5,000/- towards processing charges. However SEBI is not be under any
obligation to respond to a request for guidance made under this scheme, and shall not be liable to disclose the
reasons for declining to reply the request. Confidentiality of Request
Any person submitting a letter or written communication under this scheme may request that it receive confidential
treatment for a specified period of time not exceeding 90 days from the date of the Department’s response. The
request shall include a statement of the basis for confidential treatment. If the Department determines to grant
the request, the letter or written communication will not be available to the public until the expiration of the
specified period. If it appears to the Department that the request for confidential treatment should be denied, the
requestor will be so advised and such person may withdraw the letter or written communication within 30 days
of receipt of the advise, in which case the fee, if any, paid by him would be refunded to him. In case a request has
been withdrawn under clause (c), no response will be given and the letter or written communication will remain
with the SEBI but will not be made available to the public. If the letter or written communication is not withdrawn,
it shall be available to the public together with any written staff response.
A no action letter or an interpretive letter issued by a Department constitutes the view of the Department but will
not be binding on SEBI, though the SEBI may generally act in accordance with such a letter. The letter issued by
a Department under this scheme should not be construed as a conclusive decision or determination of any
question of law or fact by SEBI. Such a letter cannot be construed as an order of SEBI under Section 15T of the
Act and shall not be appealable. Where a no action letter is issued by a Department affirmatively, it means that
the Department will not recommend enforcement action to the Board, subject to other provisions of this scheme.
